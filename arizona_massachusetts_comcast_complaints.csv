"Had Comcast. Overall the terrible experience everyone else is describing but there was no other provider in my area at the time, so we just dealt with it. Ultimately moved out of my apartment to an area that was serviced by other providers, so I called to cancel my account. Took forever, but finally get through, and take my hardware back to the store. KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. Had to deal with a debt collector for 9 months claiming I owed money for not returning the hardware. Luckily I had physical proof. I honestly would have just paid the $60 or whatever it was if I wasn't sure they'd just keep calling. Would deny liability, it would get kicked to a different debt collection agency, someone new would call me a few months later. FINALLY went away, but I will never use Comcast again. The best part is that when I'd call for customer service, they would ""accidentally"" disconnect my call. HINT: If you want to cancel services or complain, choose the option on the customer service menu for ""add more services."" They'll connect you to an agent immediately and you can ultimately get them to connect you to the right department directly. They'll probably still disconnect you a few times though.","First off, I've been without internet for a week and on demand for a week as well. So I call the second day after nothing worked the first day to schedule a visit and the automated system kept saying that there was an outage in my area and it'll be resolved by 12:36. So I call later that afternoon and tell them and they try to send signals to the modem or whatever and it wouldn't work. So we scheduled a visit for that Friday between 10-12. Mind you that the first option they gave me was for the following freaking Monday and I said HECK NO that is way too long, I have a business to run.So the guy came on Friday at 1:30 NOT between 10-12 because I saw him pull up, he sat there for like 20 minutes and when I looked again he was freaking gone! So now I'm a little hot, so I call and ask what the heck is going on and why'd he just leave and the lady said, ""Well there's another outage in your area and he wouldn't have been able to do anything but he should have at least came to your door and told you but he didn't"". So later we rescheduled another appointment for Sunday between 3-4 and confirmed it.So I don't go to church. I'm here waiting on them to come and it's 4 and all call like, ""Where are you guys?"" And this lady on the phone tells me that it has been rescheduled for freaking Tuesday! I'm like WTF! Seriously! How the heck can you just do that?!! She said that after further checking for like 10 mins that the local office called to reschedule but no one picked up so we couldn't confirm. I was like, ""But you just said it's scheduled for Tuesday so how the heck did you confirm that if no one picked up?"" They didn't call by the way. So you just don't come?? You cancel it on your own and don't freaking show up?!! She said ""yes ma'am that's correct..."" So I'm pissed by now and then she says that someone will call me back by 6 with a rescheduled... No one has called!!! This isn't the first time something like this has happened... But I can guarantee it'll be the last... I'M GOING WITH DIRECT!!! âœŒ"
"I was experiencing some technical difficulties with my on demand service in June. Technical support solution to this problem was to reset my box. After a couple of attempts they seemed to have the system up and running. The support rep asked me if I was able to access any movies. I said yes. He said ""you're all set"". This problem happened again in July. They redid the whole previous process again. Again telling me it's all set. In August my fiance called regarding an entirely different issue, went to automated system, told him his account balance was almost $500.00. We thought that had to be a mistake. After speaking with the billing dept we found out there was over 100 on-demand movies ordered in 1 month. I was really confused due to I had a lock on the service & a code would be needed to make any purchase. I did not give anyone this code. Apparently, when tech support reset my boxes it wiped out all of my parental settings. So, my 5 yr old son was able to order anything he wanted to watch. A little over 100 movies and episodes. I made 5 phone calls about this issue in the following 2 days. Comcast/Xfinity refused to remove the charges saying the movies and episodes were watched. The supervisor I requested to speak to never called me back. Finally I spoke to a rep that reviewed the account and got a supposed supervisor to approve a credit to my account due to our history not showing these sort of purchases before or any incidences like this. She went on to say she would need to split the credit into 2 due it exceeding her credit applying limit. She thanked me for being a loyal customer and we hung up. Well, after making a payment earlier this week I come home to find my service interrupted. It was too late to speak to anyone at 9:30 pm so I called the following afternoon. Only to find out after we hung up after that call in August, there was a so called review which lead to someone determining the credits would not to applied to my account due to the movies and episodes were all watch. Even though their technical support wiped out my parental settings and told me I was all set. I am so dissatisfied with this whole experience I am returning my equipment. I will never be a Comcast/Xfinity customer ever again.","So, after having gone over Comcast's measly 300Gb data cap for a full year, I call up to cancel. I'm transferred to customer retention, where I explain my problem. Which is: I signed up for unlimited Internet. You changed the unlimited to limited because you don't like people streaming Netflix or downloading video games or you know, any of the 1000s of reasons people have for using the Internet. This wonderful customer retention specialist tells me he can give me a 500gb data cap and free HBO for a year. Wow. And just the month before I called to see about getting a higher package but was told that 300gb is the highest limit for residential customers. Whatever. Maybe they changed their mind. I took it. First month after that, no problems. Second month, my bill comes in and sure enough, I'm being charged for data overages. Called up Comcast again. 45 minute wait time. Just to be told that I was never signed up for any 500gb data cap plan, that the month where I wasn't charged for overages was a month where they had given me a ""pass""...one of three months allotted for customers who go over their data allotment. I've been going over my data plan for two years straight. I used those three months up the first three months they began instituting data caps. Liars. That's all these people do. Say something to get you off the phone and let someone else deal with you later. From now on, I'll record every call I have with these thieving liars and I urge everyone else to do the same. And when you catch them, post it where people can see."
"Consistently, with the last couple of weeks (at least), I have had slow web page loading, download and upload speed, and poor reliability of packet/datagram transmission. I feel that they intentionally misrepresent their operational products and should be held accountable. Their patronizing customer service is apparently part of their policy to placate to cover for poor performance.","After 8 years I was very disappointed with my recent experience with Comcast/Xfinity. I contacted the company about transferring my service because the Commercial assured me that they could make moving easy. To me this was really false advertisement. Despite contacting xfinity in advance, I received two different appointments, which required me to be present both days and when day 1 arrived No one showed up or even gave courtesy of calling. On day 2 service personnel was an hour late and when he arrived he told me he needed additional help and would not be available for another week. No one took me serious. It's almost like the company treated me as if I wasn't big enough for them to show concern."
"Been dealing with a nightmare at Comcast for at least 3 years now. I pay $90 a month for high-speed internet and receive half the speed I pay for. I have to keep calling there for them to turn my internet speed up. Then my service works good for a few days and it's right back down again. I've been through modems, wireless internet boxes, and still nothing but problems. They are no doubt in my mind throttling back on internet service.",This is one company you do not want to deal with. We got Comcast the middle of July and the first bill came in around the first of August for 200$.That's with no extra charges. There is not one person that I talked to that has not lied to me. Since July I've had my cable shut off twice after agreeing to pay them 103$ on August 31. They were the one that told me to pay that amount not me. Every time I talk to someone they tell me something different. I've asked them to listen to our conversations but they won't. This company has put me through so much crap. It's unbelievable. Like I said there has not been one person that works for Comcast that has not lied to me. If you're looking for a honest and reputable company then Comcast is not the one. Comcast is the most crooked company I have ever met.
I signed up for a one day pass with XFINITY when I was back in Boston. The password wasn't working even after resetting it so I called the number on the email. The customer service person forwarded me to the technical support person who then forwarded me to the Wi-Fi department who then forwarded me to someone that suggested that I call the number that I first called!!! After complaining that I was being sent in circles one guy tried to help by calling the initial number. Never got this resolved. I DO NOT suggest using their one day service. Find another carrier.,"Okay, I had this technician come out about 2 weeks ago to hook up my Xfinity voice and internet service. He goes out back and sees my small garden blocking the area he had to work. So instead of avoiding my plants, this fool pulls up my wooden border and tosses it in the yard. He also stomped on all my plants like they weren't there. The wooden border is heavy with about 3 or 4 large nails sticking out. The thing was in my yard with the nails up... Anyone could have come through and stepped on it or tripped on the log. My son is the one who found it and informed me after he had left.Also, before he finished work at my house and before my son discovered the mess made outside, he left and said he had to go elsewhere to finish another job then come back to my house. He left and came back 45 minutes later then had the nerve to sit on my couch for 10-15 minutes saying he had to wait until a certain time to ""clock in"". WTF? So, you're gonna sit in my house watching TV until it's time to work? Really? I called Comcast and filed a complaint. I was told I would hear something after Memorial Day. I still haven't and I don't think I will because they just don't give a damn. But they had my bill posted to the account 2 days later."
"If you're ever planning on getting Comcast internet provider, don't. Because they will cheat you on the pricing for packages that are expensively horrible. They make false advertisements of claiming to be the fastest internet provider. They're not. Imagine paying $60 a month for average internet to work on things, but it seems like your internet fluctuate like crazy and it is as slow as a 1 GB phone internet service. And going to customer support? Calling doesn't work because you'll call them and they'll tell you the same darn thing every time as a solution for your internet -- ""Restart your modem."" No, it doesn't work. And then you try to negotiate with them on other possibilities to fix this issue, yet all they do is curve you into other directions trying to show you more packages and making you pay even more for even more horrible services. Like are you going to help me or not? Or are you just going to curve me and distract me and cheat me and make me pay more than what I request? Comcast takes a step even further in creating XFINITY WiFi from your modem without your consent. At the start of set-up, they create the internet leaving it open. By doing that people can use your internet without paying a single bill, while you're here paying heavy loads. And honestly if you're new to tech well let me just explain to you just how false marketing this company and just how bullshit this company is. First off your modem, or your internet box. The insides are made in the 90s. They're not modern stuff. They just put the 90s insides in a new plastic case and say they're state of the art modems. They do this so they pay less on providing these internet boxes and it doesn't even work well either way, and the fact that they make you pay for renting their modem too, is just full of bull crap. Like calling them wouldn't help. They even go as far in disrespect as hanging up the call on you midway without even answering your questions. This company can't provide internet for life, yet they still falsely advertise about it. I suggest looking for a different internet service other than Comcast. Its better to save lots of money and have a good internet standing, than paying a whole lot and getting internet slow as a sloth.","Comcast has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are trained people who read what is required. Their system requires you to be on the phone handed off several times until you get to a person who makes promises of a package that is never delivered. Most of the people I believe aren't US Citizens because of their accents. There is a language barrier, a lack of respect. They will interrupt and have a rude undertone while reading ""polite"" scripted words that are untrue to their demeanor. It's obvious that they don't care and hand you off a million times, hoping you get frustrated and hang up. They lie to meet quota and I only hope that my area will have more cable options in the future."
"They promise 100 m download for their blast service. My computer NEVER got over 72 and during peak hours it dwindled down to 15 m on the speed test. They had 101 excuses for this including blaming my laptop. No credit given for service I was not getting. They do a transfer of service and move my billing cycle 2 weeks earlier. This caused a $100.00 discrepancy in my normal monthly bill. Tried to explain what happened but they cannot do simple math and justified my bill as accurate even though I was getting ripped off for 2 weeks of service for them changing the billing cycle and them charging a month in advance. FIOS is not in my area but wish it was. My mother has FIOS and it is 100X better than Comcast with 100X better customer service. Don't be another Comcast victim, get FIOS if all possible.",Our Comcast services have been out since Friday and the rep said she scheduled an appointment for a tech to come out this morning between 10-12. I got the automated call at 9:50 to confirm appt and two minutes later I get a call saying the appointment was completed but no tech has even came yet. Have been sitting in my living room for hours waiting and no one has knocked on my door. When I call to report this I get run around and told they would reschedule because they have no one available. I take online college courses and I have assignments due before midnight Sunday. Now my grades are going to drop due to inefficient workers at Comcast. Thanks for allowing me to pay for no services and my future failing grades Comcast!!
"I have been calling Comcast out to my house for almost a year now. They have been out over 6 times. I was told to upgrade for the 50 Mbps and lucky at some points getting about 10. Now since last time a month ago they replaced the modem again and now only getting to 2 Mbps. Now they said I have been paying for 50 Mbps but not having the codes setup for it. Working with them to get fix again and trying to get some sort of credit. Each time I ask for a credit it's amazing how in the peak of the day when I call their sales system is down. But, when call them back to ask to add a package to my account that is working...","My problems have existed from the 1st month I signed up for Comcast internet, phone and cable TV service. I have gone weeks at time without all these services, I have to drive to a local retailer to report outages usually. The reps on the other end are reading from a script and fail to sense my urgency, because they won't take down my info before the internet goes down time and time again. The phone system is terrible, I usually get popping and crackling on the line, or when I answer the phone I can't hear the people I called, but they can hear me. I have had technicians out here every week some months and multiple times in a week as well. I was treated rudely by a customer support staff person in your local office when identifying the problems and being told nothing was wrong.I went to the state attorney generalâ€™s office to register a complaint this past year and it did garner some response from your company. I will be following up with them again. I cannot make phone calls or receive phone calls. What am I paying for. I have been a customer for over 10 years and the problems have only multiplied. For such a large corporate entity you have serious service issues. I bought new phones at the suggestion of a customer rep, but your technicians checked my phones out and said my equipment is not the problem. More wasted money. I appreciate your attention to this matter."
"I pay $50 a month for the ""economy"" internet service which is supposed to give me 1.5-3 Mbps but my family can't even watch a streaming video on Roku at night because the service is so slow. All it does is keep loading. Small businesses run entire offices off of 1.5-3 Mbps of Internet service, why can't a small family of 3 run the usual technology devices? I call Comcast every few weeks to get assistance with my issue. I spend an hour on the phone and nothing gets resolved. They reset my modem and try to seek me faster internet service which is 50% more than I'm paying now. I have zero options for other internet providers in my area and feel Comcast should be allowed to monopolize the business and continue to provide horrible service.","After deciding to give Comcast a second chance, believing that they now had better customer service, I now know I was WRONG. First, even ordering service was a headache. I placed my order online, which went ok. Then I received a 'Welcome to Comcast' email. Less than an hour later I received another email, stating that I needed to call to set up installation and my order was not fully processed. I called and they could not set up an appointment at that time and someone would call me back within 8 hours. No call, so I called them. After 45 minutes or so, I finally got an installation date and was able to access my account online.Second, I was told my package came with DVR but did not received the DVR box. Instead I received two HD boxes. I don't have HD TVs. After spending over two hours chatting with a representative to get a DVR box, I still don't have it because the order did not go through properly and is sitting in their system in limbo (again). Third, I received my first bill and there are two additional installation charges I was never told about or authorized. I was told there was one install fee for the technician to come and install which would be for $39.95. I am also being charged for another install fee of $15 for an additional outlet."
I have never had a good experience with their customer service. Always long wait times and are never helpful at all. I would never be a customer if I had a choice but they're the only provider in my city. Worst company ever!!!,"I have had Comcast for almost a year now and it is the worst cable company. Their customer service is terrible and the employees are incompetent. We had an issue with our box for approximately 3 months and had a technician come out and replace the HD cable. That was a temporary fix while other problems had come up. We spoke to a manager to have our problem resolved and he scheduled us for a technician only to find out he never scheduled it. We discovered this after the technician never showed up. We scheduled another appointment and the reps mixed up our scheduled times so for 2 consecutive days we had no technician. Finally, we were able to get a technician to show up and he called the wrong phone number and then continued to sit outside our residence for approximately 15 minutes. To say the least, I would rather go without cable and internet than to ever have to deal with Comcast."
"I ""updated"" to Comcast blast about a month ago. Since then my WiFi is at a CRAWL and that is saying it nicely. There is no way I am getting the promised speed. Dial up was faster and of course, no answer from Comcast. As soon as I figure another service out this company is out for me. They should be sued for false advertisement.","I called in to upgrade my service to a different box and that's when I found out I had been being charged for some equipment that I never knew about. After researching I found out that a previous technician that had came to my house left equipment there. I had called to get a new box one day. Well, the tech that was supposed to come was running late and he sent another tech out. However when this tech came out he left two extra boxes at my house on my wall unit. Well I never looked for any extra equipment because when he left all I knew is that my cable was working so I didn't notice any extra equipment that was left. He brought this equipment into my home. All I know is he did what he was supposed to and left. The boxes were left unnoticed. However, he added those boxes that he left to my bill that were never hooked to anything in my home to get the monkey off of his back.After calling that day and the technician advised I had been getting billed for equipment I hadn't used much less knew it was in my house. So he advised not to worry they would get my account credited. After calling back concerning getting the account credited I received someone else on the line that told me this would have to be done in installments. So I asked how would it be credited and they advised over a two or three year time frame. So that's when I asked to speak with someone in management. She advised that ""We're not a bank so we're not about to credit you that money back all at once"" even though they've already been paid cash they should've never been paid whenever they billed me. The technician that showed up that shouldn't have that day should have been held responsible. Because I didn't come into Comcast to pick their equipment up this was left in my home and was never hooked to anything.So after speaking with her I was so furious I advised her she could cancel my service out. However, they kept it running until the end of January 2015. So now it's April and I have a bill collector calling my phone saying I owe them a 1000+. I advised them I only owed about 400 dollars and I was willing to pay what I owe. Well come to find out they had equipment still showing on my account and also that equipment that had been picked up that the technician had left. So I asked who in their right mind would pay for something they don't owe.I called Comcast this morning and told them this needed to be corrected because they sent a technician out to my home and he collected any and all equipment and I signed off on it. Now they're telling me, ""Oh well there's still 500 dollars worth of equipment out there."" She advised me it would take 15 days to try and get this handled. I asked her in the mean time what am I to tell these creditors that are threatening to put this bill on my credit. She advised they would handle it, but I've heard this before.I am very displeased with this service and the bill continuously would rise and they would always have some type of excuse why it raised. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I pay my bills and I try to stay in good credit standing with people I do business with. I just don't care to pay someone for something that I never owed and have been paying for it for years before it was realized. I believe in doing what's right and I feel that just because you have this huge Corporation doesn't mean you can treat people anyway that you want to. There's a God that sits high and looks low. :) Thanks for listening."
"Comcast is terrible. I don't usually do reviews, but this time I feel that the potential Comcast customers should know what they are getting into once they sign up for Comcast services. I have been with Comcast the past 5 years and I never saw the services so bad. I signed up for a triple play with maximum 125 MBPS blast internet speed. That was what I was told in the beginning. Everything went pretty well till this March when things started to go really awry.First the speed came down to about 40-45 MBPS. But I didn't complain much because it was still good enough for browsing. But in April, 2015 I wanted to watch some cricket matches (the world cup) by live streaming. I just could not get my TV stream anything. I complained to customer services, and after about 5 days they did send out a technician. Have you ever had a Comcast technician come and fix the problem for you? They are so bloody arrogant and make you feel so low. Typical attitude: How stupid are you not to be able to figure out the solution for yourself; They do something and tell you everything will be fine from now. And the problem remains and you have no idea what was the issue and what he fixed. They make you feel like they are bestowing a huge honor just by showing up to your door. They are always out of the door in 5 minutes max. So the problem remained and I complained to customers services again. After another week or so they let me know that maybe the problem is with the router. So they said someone will come and replace the router and everything will be fine.The technician came, installed a new router and was out of my place before the router was actually online. Before leaving, he asked me to get an usb cable and other things from Amazon to speed up my services. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about when I am supposed to have a wireless connection for all devices and I have a small apartment and all devices are close to the router. Finally I decided I have had enough (my internet speed is now down to 15 MBPS) and I cancelled the services from June 4, 2015. I called them o/a May 24 and schedule return of all equipment. I also pay all my outstanding bills. Imagine my consternation I receive a new bill of $122 for services from June 4 to July 3, 2015. I called the customer services again and somehow navigate my way to speak to someone at the payments department. I tell him my problem and he asks me to call cancellation department and resolve this. I request him to send a note to cancellation department or maybe talk to them internally to resolve my problem. He flatly tells me, that's not something they do and it is my responsibility that I resolve it with cancellation department. Ridiculous internal communication and follow up. I guess in order to not be charged with bills for services not received, I shall have to call them again. So sad. Comcast used to be a good company. Next time I will choose a smaller service provider who will attend to my needs and solve my problem. I wish some of us will get together and file a class action suit to hold these Company to better standards. You pay a lot and in return you are treated so bad that it hurts.","I had the absolute worst experience with Comcast on yesterday. I called to do a simple transfer of service. Well, guess what, it wasn't that simple. The young lady, though nice enough, screwed up my account. My transfer was not supposed to be until Saturday but my service at my current location were suspended yesterday by the time I ended my call. Had she been more concerned with setting up my account than talking about her deadbeat baby daddy for thirty minutes, maybe she would not have turned off my services 4 days too soon.I called back at 2:03 pm CST to get this issue resolved and all hell broke loose. I first talked to Shay. She told me if she turned my services back on I would have to call back again to have them disconnected on the day of my transfer (stupid, right). I told her I was not going to call back because I should not have been turned off in the first place. I then asked to speak to a supervisor. She purposely transferred me to a different department (the sales department) and I was on hold for about 45 minutes. Andrew answered. He was rude, and refused to transfer me to a supervisor. He instead purposely transferred me to the wrong department (billing) again. I was on hold for about 30 minutes. Now I am in the billing department. Mind you, I have a 0.00 balance because my account is set up for auto pay or should I say my account was set up for auto pay (cancelled that). The rep in the billing department does not speak or understand English very well. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and he refused unless I gave him access to my account which I refused since he could not help me. So, he hung up on me. It's now 3:45 pm CST and I have nothing resolved!!! I call back and ask for a supervisor. I get Corey. He is rude, can't help, puts me on hold after I repeatedly told him that I did not want to be placed on hold and then still does nothing to help me. I finally just said, ""Forget it. Cancel the account. Disconnect all services."" Well, Corey can't do that either. He transfers me to Customer Solutions. I speak with Christy. She deserves a raise and a promotion. She is the only Comcast employee that I spoke with yesterday that has more than empty space between her two ears. I have to admit, by the time I spoke with her, I was beyond pissed and irritated so yes I had a very bad attitude. Throughout the conversation, she was very professional, helpful, and never lost patience with me. She was able to get my services restarted, and was able to set up my transfer correctly!!! By the time I got off the phone with Christy, it was 5:45 pm CST. 3 hours and 45 minutes to fix an issue that your rep caused is more than ridiculous. And for your reps to have the nerve to have an attitude with me because I demand quality customer service just like you demand on time payments is a slap in the face.You can keep your Comcast Guarantee because it is nothing but lies. Your guarantee should say ""We promise to feed you a bunch of lies every time you call, place you on hold for as long as we like, take forever to resolve your issues, refuse you the right to speak with management, and bill you extremely high prices because we can!"""
"I called Comcast to up my internet speed. They told me I would have to pay 12/month for 50 mps. I did not know I was only getting 25 mps with my regular service. I tested my upload/download speed with their utility and I wasn't getting anything better than 32 mps. I called support and spent a total of 10 hours on two calls with tech support. The second call I was transferred 6 times. On the first call, the tech kept saying they could not see my device online so I was not connected to the internet. I told them I was on a VOIP line so it was impossible that I wasn't connected to the internet. This conversation went on for 30 min. I was on a 30 day trial for a new contract. I had been a customer for 17 yrs. They were going to send out a technician but I insisted that I not be charged for this visit no matter what the outcome. No one would commit to that so I canceled the visit. On the day that the visit was supposed to be canceled a guy shows up at my door saying he is with Xfinity home security. He explained that he traveled 2 hours to get to my house and had paperwork that said I called. I told him we don't have the security package, never did. He sat with me for almost an hour and agreed that this was all a major blunder but said to go ahead with the new product installation as I was dropping Comcast and if I wanted to come back he would personally handle the contract. I said fine and the following week had their major competitor installed. Since install I have consistently had 58-63 mps with the internet and that's with 4 laptops, 1 Ipad and two phones. In addition, the competitor bundle of internet, TV and phone is 15$/month cheaper than what I had been paying for all three. Also, I have HD coming in on my TV which I did not have with Comcast. Have to admit that the new service does have less channels but for the price and service it is worth it. Besides, we don't watch a lot of TV anyway.","Every time I have had to call Comcast after about 5Pm, it has been a nightmare. You get canned responses and nothing is ever fixed. I've also had problems with being ""disconnected"" when talking to customer service during the day. Who knows what that is all about, but somebody needs to start up a new internet/cable company. Seriously, Comcast needs more competition. Eventually I get things done, but have just about decided I can live without internet and cable TV in my house. Every year it gets more expensive and it's just not worth it."
"First off, the fact that their product wasn't working properly was already a bad start and secondly, terrible customer service just ruined the whole mood. Hereâ€™s what happened. My Internet was not working properly and when I had called the customer service, they were absolutely wonderful - treated me with respect and all. But here comes the bad part. They directed me to the Advanced Wireless Department and some whacko picks up the phone half-awake answering the phone with a very dreadful ""Hello?"" Very professional (Sarcasm). So I was telling him about what was happening with my Internet and halfway in, I hear the guy yawn and hang up the phone! The worst part about it is that this guy might be doing this to OTHER customers with no punishment whatsoever. Goes to show Comcast hires some very bad workers. Disappointed.","We had Comcast a decade ago. It was a nightmare trying to get them to stop charging us after we cancelled the service and returned the equipment. They even tried to charge us for the equipment after we had returned it. Thankfully, we kept the receipt handy and had to send copies several times to get them to stop charging us for it. Now we are having the same issue. I was told that they were much better these days, but again they are charging us for services after we had cancelled. They claim they did not receive the call in April 2013 when I cancelled the service. They are still playing their stupid games of pleading ignorance. They need to be sued. There are enough complaints for a class action against Comcast."
"On numerous occasions my wifi has been disabled causing me to contact the company, etc. It would not be a huge deal except that I pay numerous amounts in fees and charges for the service that never actually works. I know other people have issues with WIFI and I'm surprised Comcast has not had to make amends to their overcharges and unfair practices.","I called to get internet and cable services in April 2013. I paid for the first month's bill, equipment, and shipping for all of the equipment on the date I ordered the service. The equipment received was short three adapter boxes (although we received the additional remotes). I called back and they shipped the adapter boxes immediately. All three tiny boxes came in the same package. A shipping charge of $29.85 ($9.95 per adapter) was applied to my account for these adapter boxes (that should have been included in the original box and original shipping charges). I have contacted Customer Service three times since receiving this charge (once in May, twice in June, and now finally today is the fourth time). Each time, the representative agreed that I should not be charged and that a credit would be applied.The third call was on 6/20/13 at 12:12 pm. Allen, employee number **, informed me that the credit of $29.85 to my bill for shipping fees that should not have been charged was still being reviewed by a supervisor. I explained that I had been told this twice in the past month and asked to speak to a supervisor. He placed me on hold and upon his return said that all supervisors were busy but he was able to discuss this matter with an account specialist. He said that what he could do for me is to go ahead and apply the credit to my account (and was doing so while we were on the phone together). He explained to me that the past reps had only submitted the credit to a supervisor. He assured me that the credit would show on my next bill and that I would not have any service interruptions due to this $29.85 charge.It is 7/02/2013. I had to contact customer service again because they shut my service off due to the ""past due"" amount of $29.85. I went to pay the bill online (which I always pay on the 2nd of the month) but was not allowed to submit it unless I included the $29.85. I paid the full amount. I contacted an account rep through online chat to discuss the credit I am due. Joancien typed, ""I have fully applied the $28.95 shipping fee credits on the account. The services are now also restored since the past due amount has been credited."" She also stated, ""The previous credits quoted by our previous reps were not posted on the account since the previous reps only submitted the credit request to a supervisor but the credits were not applied.""Service was restored so let's hope that it is due to her issuing the credit and not because I paid the bill. I hope it does not show up on the next bill, which I am afraid that it will. In addition to this, the internet service does not work without completing a reset every time (and then sometimes it still doesn't work). A technician has looked at it and ""repaired the problem"" but it still fails. I have also spent countless hours on the phone with Support over this issue. Keep in mind, I have only had the service since the middle part of April 2013 and it is now July 2, 2013.Needless to say, I have spent so much of my time devoted to trying to get at least decent service from Comcast. All in all, they have poor equipment and very poor customer service. Sadly, unless I want to go with satellite service, Comcast is my only option."
"I received a call in November 2014 saying that I should upgrade my Modem. They told me to go on this site ** and depending on which item you pick allowed up to click to buy straight from Amazon.com. And that's exactly what I did and bought a used one. Unfortunately, that's what I did. 3 hours on the phone, 2.5 hours at the customer service office, I still cannot register my modem. A legit modem that I bought from a Amazon reseller online. Their advice? You should have bought a new and paid full price. Why did you buy used? Honey, you gave me the link and I bought the used one because it was 50% off and it was an option. Don't patronize me! I pay my bills on time, just let me register this online. This regionalization of buying modems and monopolizing a market is frustrating to consumers.","Comcast Xfinity steals and if you don't catch them at it, they will keep your money. This is how they do it. You move to another address and reinstall Comcast in your new home. You have already paid the Comcast Bill in advance. You have paid your last month's bill and owe a zero balance. As soon as you move into your new home, two weeks later, you get a new bill. These are the charges they add, with the excuse that ""someone forgot to give you a credit on the other bill.""3) You may have already paid $200 in a deposit.Instead of your bill being for a previous month or the current month, you will be charged again for a month in advance, a new bill for the bill you already paid last month at the previous address and your bill will be around $260 to $300 instead of around $95 to $100 (includes Cable TV and Internet).Now, if you do not check your bill out, and call Comcast, they will keep all the money you send in. They will not correct the bill and claim that ""oh well, that's how the bill comes out when you move to a new address.""I had to call twice and demand that I speak to a supervisor and threaten them with contacting Consumer Fraud and the State Attorney General's Office if they did not correct my bill. I was then told that ""yes"" they would adjust the bill and ""give me credit for payment for the previous months bill...that was paid in advance."" To date, they have not done so.I am so angry at being defrauded by Comcast that I have just signed up with another cable and DSL company and will save about $80 a month.Check your bills, especially if you move. Comcast and all the other service providers you may have contracted with because they know what the are doing and figured out that most of you people are too trusting and will just pay the bill. If I had paid the bill, along with about 5 million other Comcast providers who also moved this month. Comcast would have collected $10 million dollars in your money that you would not get back, because you didn't know.Comcast are Thieves... watch your bills every month... especially if you move."
Got a new Comcast internet connection. The internet cuts in and out and does not work all the time. I spoke to Comcast 4 times over the last week and still I get the run around. Comcast is the worst cable internet service and if I have a choice I would never use it.,"On August 14, I contacted Comcast to inquire about their services and see if they were available in my area (being that it was a new area and has only been around for two years and such). I told the representative this as well as let them know that my future neighbors had the service.I asked for phone and Internet since I'm not a big TV person anyway. I was told that yes, the service could be placed in the address I mentioned before. But to be on the safe side to call at least a week for them to do a walk-through to verify.I decided to give them a bit more time so on September 16, 8 a.m., I called and spoke to a Matt, had the inspection set and was given a code. I was told to call back on Tuesday to check but most likely would be getting a call back to let me know. No call back so I called on Tuesday morning.  I have to actually demand they take the number I had been given.The person I spoke to, Todd, I believe, said that no order was given and if I wanted I could set that up. However, after he got the number, he said that the check for service had not been done and it should be done either today or tomorrow, so call back then.I called morning the next day and again I have to force the employee to take the call but this time I heard that not even my name is on the order in the right place. Matt, the first person I talked to, my name is actually on the notes but this is all. The survey was completed now ""but no call because they were waiting for the new address to be added into their system. ""How long will this take? A week, I am told.  To enter a new address?  You can't do that? No, sorry, different department. Okay.  Well I suppose I can wait.Sadly, I could not wait.  I either had to have a phone line installed or else lose out on the discount for my new home owners insurance. So I called back before five and told them what was going on.Now I am told I had to wait two weeks before the address is entered. Then another week to have someone come out to the house.  First I'm thinking back over the reason I was delayed in getting to the house in the first place.Comcast hit my ** water line so now I have trash in the line. Why? Because they were putting down their equipment and did not check with my builders. Of course the builders are still fighting them to pay them for the damage done.Back to the call, I stated that I was told this would only take about a week to go through. Checks, address entered and service sent out and installed. I was told sorry and to call back tomorrow.  It should have already been put into the system.I called back the next day and and the day after and the day after excluding Sunday. Monday, the 26th, I called to talk to someone and when I was told it would be another two weeks before my address would be processed, I asked to speak to a manager. I was told, ""Well, I will note it and since they are in a meeting you should get a call back with two hours at the latest.""I actually allowed four hours to go by before I called back. I told the new person I was talking to what had happened before and that I wanted to speak to a manager. She told me that I should have been given a numbered code so that if anything happened I could use that to get a hold of a manager. She then apologized for everything and said she would expedite my call to a manager in which she did. She actually transferred me to a guy named Chris.I told Chris everything I had gone through so far, including the damaged water line to having to change alarm companies because of Comcast dragging their feet. He then mentioned confusion on why this had not been taken care of. I was given his direct line, was told that he would be contacting the contractors to expedite my address into the system as well as the visit that was to come.He said he would call me back sometime today or at the latest tomorrow with a status update. It was not until an hour of getting off the phone that my contact number was never asked for. I try to be patient, I really do, but man this is rubbish. After reading the reviews, I am actually cringing and wondering if I should bother with this company at all.I do know they have personally damaged wiring in a friend's apartment when service had gone out to ""fix"" the issue. The issue was never fixed, the friend in question had to just cancel the service. I do know one thing: I won't contract with them if this manager Chris can get his people in order."
"Worst customer service EVER. I spent four hours on the phone with six people on two continents over the course of three days, trying to fix an internet problem that it turned out THEY caused. I then spent another hour with three more people trying to get the $110 worth of fees they'd landed me with (for the problem they caused) removed from my bill. The reps, or laughably named ""account executives,"" are worse than useless. The first two I spoke with had no suggestions at all besides ""unplug it and then plug it back in"". With the first, I could hear other people coaching him from the background. The third flat-out lied to me to get me off the phone. I didn't get the same answers from any two reps, and as it turned out, none of the answers they gave me were right anyway. If Comcast is allowed to merge with Time-Warner, it will be a kick in the face to every customer in the country. As far as I can tell, the only reason most people are signed on with Comcast is because there is no other option. It's certainly the case with me - I'd leave in a heartbeat if there was any other service provider in my area.",
"I had to smile at the latest public exposure of Comcast's attitude toward customers (The viral bit about the customer trying to cancel his account). Actually, the smile came when I read Comcast's public statement about this latest fiasco. The response was supposedly written by Tom Karinshak, Senior VP - Customer Experience. I've heard numerous people saying they feel sorry for the agent involved in this debacle because he was most likely only doing as told by his superiors. I suspect there is truth in this assumption.Our problems with Comcast began over two years ago (TV and Internet). After months of trying to get someone at Comcast to care about our problems, I contacted Corporate. They assigned a senior level employee (their word) to help. This was almost a year ago. Since then, numerous techs have come out to ""fix"" our problems. Each tech finds something s/he says is the cause of all our issues. The ""something"" is fixed and the tech leaves. An hour or two later, the issues reoccur. Comcast keeps sending out senior techs who find new problems and ""fix"" them. At this point, they have replaced just about every part of the system and yet the service issues remain. Meanwhile, getting anyone at the Company to respond to e-mail or telephone calls takes days and even weeks. Keep in mind, by now we are dealing with people at the Corporate level, not the low level field reps.We are very frustrated and fed-up. Every month the bill must be paid, but no one seems to care that we lose channels in mid-program or that our Internet connection is often slower than old-fashioned dial-up. A month ago, we sent another letter to Mr. Karinshak explaining our frustration. We have heard nothing. However, after talking with friends and doing some online research, I now understand why. Mr. Karinshak may be in charge of customer experience, but he never sees any negative feedback. He is so well insulated from customers he has little or no idea how poorly his company is fulfilling the terms of the ""customer guarantee.""([I'm not sure you can call mere words a guarantee!) If Mr. Karinshak wants to know how his company is performing, I suggest he make himself more accessible. Read the forum posts. Allow customers to e-mail him directly. Spend some time in the field listening to customers. Not all of us are cranks or people bent on dragging a company through the mud and muck. Some of us are simply frustrated and desperate to be heard by someone who will effect meaningful change.",
"As has happened with others, I received a letter urging me to upgrade my modem. The letter stated, in the fourth paragraph: ""To protect our environment, please properly recycle your older modem... Please note that there is no unreturned equipment fee for your older modem."" Then, on my latest bill, I received a monthly charge for this modem. When I called, I was essentially told ""Too bad, you have to return it or face monthly charges.""",
"I am a client of Comcast Business Internet for the past 4 years. A couple of days ago, they performed a migration from Microsoft Exchange 2007 to Microsoft Exchange 2010. They sent me an email stating that this migration will be performed on Sat night 11pm to 7am Sun (May 31, 2014 to June 1, 2014) at which time my internet services will be interrupted. However, when the service was resumed on Sunday night (much later than they said in their email), I found that they had changed my server address (which ends in comcast.net). This change in server address had a drastic effect on my Business Contact Manager within MS Outlook. It literally made it impossible for me to access my list of business contacts and their information. Over the past 4 years, I had built a list of 2,250 email subscribers and my whole business is dependent on this list. I have called their technical support list for several times now and their reps keep saying they have passed this ticket to their Tier 2 tech and they will be calling me. But I have not heard a word from Comcast's Tier 2 tech support. I feel I've been sidelined and abandoned. They created a big problem for me with this migration and now they don't want to assist in resolving this matter. Almost all of the Comcast reps I have spoken to seem to be passing the buck, claiming the problem is with me or with Microsoft.I wish these tech reps at Comcast will stop dilly dallying and get back to me promptly to resolve this huge problem that they had created due to their negligence. They failed to consider the consequences on changing the server settings on the Business Contact Manager in MS Outlook of their clients. What is really frustrating for me is that no one from their Tier 2 tech support called me up to now. Today is the 3rd day I am waiting. They just kept me waiting like they don't care. On the other hand, I am so anxious and desperate that I restraint myself from going to the bathroom as I don't want to miss their call. I am even eating my meals at the computer table so I don't miss the call from them. They have put me in so much stress for the past 3 days and they seem like they just don't care.",
"I don't own a TV. Comcast provides me with internet. They've charged me $50 to fix a problem that was their fault. They have sent me adapters, remotes, a new router without me ordering them!! Then in the tiniest writing possible, somewhere under a flap of the box it says, ""If you don't return this product in 5 days, we will begin to start charging you $ for our products"". That's such crap!! I have to take time out of my day to go to the post office or find a UPS store, find parking, wait in line, then drop off a product that I can't even USE and did not order otherwise I will be charged?! This should be illegal! I'm canceling the service.",
"We were loyal Comcast customers for twenty years. Due to financial incentives, we went with Verizon this month (March 12, 2013). We returned the Comcast box and modem to their service center the next day. Several years ago the router they provided us with failed and Comcast told us we had to get a new one at our expense, which we did. Now they claim they want the defective router returned and we have no idea what happened to it. Verizon provides a modem/router unit and Comcast is trying to charge us $45.00 for the old router. Why didn't they ask before? You think we'll ever be Comcast customers again and that we won't tell others of our experience?",
"The actual download speeds to our house at **, Somerville, MA are consistently around 2.5 mbps as measured by the FCC's speed test. Comcast's speed test consistently returns a download speed of 12 mbps. The FCC's numbers confer the dead in the water download speeds we experience. You are not delivering anything close to rates your plans are sold at. I'm tired of complaining and will be starting two class action suits against Comcast if you don't start delivering on your commitments and stop falsifying your speed test results.",
"After seeing a promotion for $150 Visa Gift Card with bundled service, I decided to try Comcast. I was to have my service installed mid-October. The day before installation, I received a call from a rep telling me my installation needed to be rescheduled because there was no service contract on file. Without that, I could not receive my promotion. I was connected to a department where answers to their questions were recorded. It was a verbal agreement to a 2-year contract with them. I was told it would take 3 months to receive my gift card. When March arrived and I had not received my card, I called to inquire about it. I was told someone would get back to me. April came, and I called again. For the second time, I was told someone would get back to me. By the time May 2 came along, I was furious. I called and was told she personally would get back to me, which she did not. I called yet again on the 8th and the man gave me my word he would look further into this and he would personally call me before the day ended. Guess what? It never happened. This morning, I spoke to yet another rep. He put me on hold for a brief period of time and came back to tell me there was no contract on file. I insisted I did indeed have my conversation recorded for a verbal contract. Now he is looking into this, saying that without a contract, I could not qualify for the gift card. He gave me his number and extension and I am to call him in a week if no one gets back to me. I am beyond angry at this point. If they don't keep their word and send me my Visa card, they can take their service and shove it where the sun don't shine. I never had a problem with RCN. I should have stayed with them, but I will definitely be returning to them!",
"I manage my husband's solo pediatric practice. Reliable phone and internet service are critical for our patients. Comcast is responsible for our phones and internet and it is very unreliable! On a busy Monday morning, like this morning, the phones go down for 30 minutes and Comcast can't tell us why. Worse, they do nothing to keep it from happening again. I pay for service that I don't get. I want Comcast to fix the problems so that phone and internet are reliable. ",
"I am writing to let you know of an issue I'm having with Comcast Customer Service. Please bear in mind, I've been a customer for 3 days. Roughly an hour after the install, my service was intermittent and the phone support folks were not able to help and suggested sending someone out to my home. Now, the appointment was scheduled for today (28 Feb 2012) between 6-7 PM. The tech didn't show and claimed I wasn't home. This is demonstrably false, I've been sitting here since 5:30 PM, waiting. No phone call, door bell ring, nothing. This is upsetting to me.I had to leave work early to get home for the appointment and that isn't easy to do. I also depend on the service which, at the moment, isn't working. Not only did the tech lie to his boss, he put me out as well. I expect a higher level of service from you and am very disappointed.",
"I use Comcast for Internet connection only. I have no choice whatsoever and pay $63.66 monthly. Out of curiosity, I checked the cost of internet connection in London (Pond Sterling 3.25), in Paris (10 Euros) and in Berlin (12 Euros). I wonder why an Internet connection in the US should be by far, more expensive?",
"As Comcast was the cable provider servicing the address of the home I purchased, I was forced to attempt to set up service with them. While on the phone with a local rep, she called the previous owners and got an okay from them to terminate service in their name. What ensued was madness.I set up installation appointments (multiple), only to have them cancelled by Comcast, because ""service already exists"" at that address. No lie, something like 10 phone calls later, I achieved installation. Despite this, my first bill was sent to the wrong address. When I called to see where my bill was, and to pay it, I was informed of this fact. I then paid my bill in full, over the phone. I checked, as always, to make sure that the payment was actually deducted from my bank account. It was.Next month (second month of service), I received a bill stating that my account was past due and my service was being shut off. A call to ""customer service"" (India), was met with a robotic, scripted response that had nothing to do with the questions I was asking. I was informed that my payment had been ""misapplied"". What!? To where, and whom? It was like pulling teeth to get ""India"" to transfer me to a supervisor or billing rep. There I was informed that my payment had been removed from my account and credited to another account. How could this happen, you may ask?The other account holder called up, and giving just the last 4 numbers of the debit card I used to pay, stated that it was his $300 payment. What did Comcast do to verify? They looked to see if anyone had made a $300 payment on the date in question using those last 4 CC numbers. True CIA level security measures! They then suggested I monitor that card for fraud. Not a bad idea. I suggested they ramp up their billing security.",
"I made an appointment for Comcast technician to come install the internet on 08/20, which is a Saturday. I wrote down the appointment date and time and was sure I made an appointment on Saturday, since I work Monday to Friday. On Friday 08/19, I got a call on my cellphone at work from a Comcast technician telling me he is at the door. I was so surprised because I was sure the appointment was next day. The guy had a really bad attitude and was impatient to check up the schedule per my request. Then he admitted it's the wrong day and hung up. The next day, Saturday afternoon, I stayed at home the entire afternoon and nobody showed up. Then I called the technician since I got his number on my call display earlier. I called him first time, he picked up and grumbled and hung up on me. Then I called again, he picked up and heard it was me again and hung up again. I was furious, then I called Comcast customer service. The customer service representative also had a really bad attitude and told me ""well, we don't have appointment until September. Now, do you want to keep it or not now?"". I was appalled. I have never had worst customer service experience in my life. ",
"I called Comcast on 10/01/2010 and ordered the new Internet 2go said the order was in and would see this item by 10/6/2010. Well, since then till 10/11/2010, I have called and asked for a tracking number and they keep saying they do not have one but it shipped. Today, I called them and they admitted it has not shipped and this was a new item for them in this area an they were trying to figure out where it was, but it look like it did not ship and they did not know how to ship it but would call me about 6 pm on 10/12/2010.Well, as you guessed it, they did not call so I called them back, again that nice apology, let me put you on hold an I will talk to a supervisor. On hold for 5 minutes and she came back and said there still working on it and earlier in the day I asked it to be shipped red and ship me another one. Guess what? They still wanna look for the other one.Earlier in the day was also told they did not know how to or where they are at to ship. I also said hum you must new on the job and seems no one knows what to do with any training and she said I been here only three days. Being in the customer service industry, big bells and whistles went of no training, high turn over, everything is scripted. Such a shame , I am now handicapped and I was gonna use this technology to make my life easier away from home. Maybe Comcast should start listening to there customers. Is Verizon FIOS any better? Lost of time and wages plus stress = $500.00",
"We pay almost $150 per month for service which includes internet!  We constantly have email issues due to Comcast IP issues.  They try to filter spam so our outbound email always gets bounced back.  I have spent at least 20 hours on the phone and internet trying to fix it and it keeps coming back.  They are our only choice, so they feel they can stick it to us as we have no choice.  The worst thing is they never notify you of issues and just do what they want.  Then when you call for help, they say someone will call you back and they usually donâ€™t.",
Absolutely awful. Constant problems. I don't watch a lot of tv. Every time I do put it on my channels won't show up that I'm already subscribed to saying to subscribe to get them so I have to contact them and go through the same hassle over and over again. Ridiculous.,
"Comcast has been terrible to work with at every turn. Every time I've had to call them to discuss charges on my bill, rate increases, slow internet and cable issues. I've spent over a half hour on the phone and usually do not get the issue resolved. If there was any other company available to use for internet and TV in my area I would immediately switch.Today, my fiancÃ© wanted to take over the Comcast bill when we moved so we were getting it turned on in her name. We entered our new address on the website and it gave us a listing of packages based on our address, we clicked ""add to cart"" on the one we wanted and it brought us to higher priced packages. Their customer ""service"" said that it wasn't available in our area but as indicated in the screenshot image attached, they are advertising it as available based on our address. Finally they agreed that it should be available for our area but told us to clear our cookies. We cleared our cookies and it immediately disconnected us. The problem continued and we literally had the exact same conversation with the next customer service rep. After I refused to clear the cookies again he told me there was nothing he could do to help.",
"I signed up for Comcast being told 500 Visa card. I got charged entire bundle then I'm only got basic. Few months later I get the box. Box is not registered so I'm on the phone for days. Then I'm waiting 10 months for Visa card... threaten a lawsuit. I get 100 gift card and another one for 50.00. I called a high up rep who went through all recorded calls, restarted my bundle, and gave me lower rate for yr 3 and 4 then a 290.00 box credit for final year. So 90.00 to 114.00 was my quote and I'm also paying 250.00 a month being shut off 2 times a month. They were individually charging me for everything. Kristin ** I believe executive customer relation in 2015 fixed it all. Now Comcast tells me they're not honoring her deal. I'm being overcharged, plus I'm being shut off. I also am still 2 yrs later waiting for 350.00 left on owed Visa card and past the deal. How am I not getting? Visa GC IS A SCAM..",
"After settling into our new home, my fiance and I, after 3 years, decided to finally get cable (we both work all day, so cable did not seem like a necessity). Because of our location, only 2 cable providers were available, Comcast and Dish Network. We called Comcast first to hear of any deals, and the sales rep told us of an 89.99 deal they were running. Only wanting a few channels, the sales rep asked us to name channels that we want so he could match a package to us. We named HGTV, Travel Channel, Food Network, as well as a few children's channels. He named a $54.99 package with 75 mbps internet and all of the channels we named included in the package. This sounded like the perfect deal!Before getting off the phone my fiance asked for the full price (including taxes) and the sales rep said it would be $54.99 plus an extra $10/month for the router and modem. We decided to just buy the router and modem to avoid the $10/month, knowing that, he gave us a price of roughly around $61/month. Perfect! Today they came to install everything, and excited to come home and settle in after work, I flipped through the channels to find the channels that were promised not available.We immediately called Comcast customer service and they stated that the 'economy plan' that we were apart of did not include the channels we named. We were also informed that we would be paying an extra $10/month for HD, and we DID NOT agree to this! The original sales rep just 'yessed and okayed' everything we asked for and completely misinterpreted the deal to us to get up to buy his product. This is NOT fair. This is NOT ok. Had we known the channels we wanted were not included, we would have never gotten cable. It is not a necessity for us, it is a luxury. The sales rep falsely advertised what he was selling to us. The customer service rep had nothing to say other than she will waive the installation fees. I have read MANY complaints online of people who have gone through the same thing as we have. Comcast sales reps need to be honest and upfront to their consumers!",
"We had a very nice installer put Xfinity DVR service for 3 rooms into our house yesterday. It worked great for that afternoon. Last night a recording showed oddness (stalling and hard to restart), then this afternoon the DVR box went into a reboot loop. It shuts off, goes through its boot process, gets a bit into that, then does it again and again. That is not the reason for this review - that is a piece of new computer hardware and they break usually very soon after turning them on if they are going to break. BUT we called customer service and told them we have been a customer for about 24 hours and the box broke. They said, ""No repair person will be available for 5 days"". 5 days?? This is the cheapest crap box company I have ever known. They do not hire sufficient techs, they don't offer refunds etc. If you have a choice, DONT use them!",
"I wrote a few days ago about the unbelievably poor customer service I have been receiving regarding unwarranted charges to my account. I still have a $496 charge when my costs should have been $109. Everyone admits the problem is on their end, but in over 10 days, no refund. I will continue writing all over the internet until something changes. NO COMPANY should be in business with a 0% customer service satisfaction. BTW, the better customer service number is 800 266 2278. If you call 800XFINITY you get the Philippines. At least I get to speak with someone here in this country and someone who will offer a direct line# when you have problems that have been as outrageously unresolved as I have.Now I have no service and called CS again yesterday. First I was told ""there is NO SUCH THING as SAME DAY SERVICE...."" then I was given a choice of between 8A to 10A or 10A to 12N for today. I chose the latter. I called at 11:40A because we hadn't even received the advance phone call. I was told he updated and said he would be there between 11:30A and 12N. At 12:39, I called again and was told I was RESCHEDULED now between 1P and 3P with expected arrival between 2P and 2:30P....no phone call....RESCHEDULED arrival??? They said they had me down for 8A to 10A, which makes this new time even MORE EGREGIOUS. What's wrong with this company? How do you ever stay in business? I now had to reschedule to TUESDAY because of appointments on Monday. My tenant has been without TV and internet since FRIDAY. Does anyone at this company even care? I have at least 4 ticket numbers that I have taken the time to save. With the other calls I just asked them ""What difference would it make?"" I was told ""none."" If you have a choice, go with Verizon Fios or any other company. ",
"I recently called Comcast just to activate internet only because I was going to go with DirecTV. The rep told me that I would pay less if I bundled internet and cable. I asked him to explain the packages to me which he did. He told me that I could get 75 Mbps plus 2 DVR's and one cable box all for $126.90 TOTAL including ALL fees. Guess what? Boxes came yesterday and internet is only 25 Mbps and my bill is $154. When I called CS, they told me that they are not responsible for what their rep discusses over the phone??? How is that possible? I was told that if I wanted 75 Mbps, there would be an extra fee of $10. I asked if they record the conversations and they said they did not know who I spoke with. This just doesn't seem right. If we aren't satisfied for any reason within 30 days, we can cancel.",
"My mother's phone was out and I called for service, saying she is 97 years old and needs a phone at all times. The service people checked the connection and said that indeed, she DID need a technician and that on an emergency basis, they would get one out the next day. I went to her home which is in a retirement community to wait. After a couple of hours, I decided to call them to make sure they knew where it was, and get an update from them.I got on the automated service, gave my phone number, and they told me they would be there within the next half hour. ""Great,"" I thought. Then the automated service said, ""Do you want to cancel this appointment?"" I said, ""NO!"" The automated voice came back and said, ""Your appointment is canceled."" Needless to say, I was very upset. It took me eight minutes to get to a real person after that, and they said that there was NOTHING they could do about this. They would send another technician out tomorrow. This was totally unacceptable and unbelievable to me. SO close and yet SO far away. When I called customer service again this morning, it was more of the same. No recompense except for the two days that her service was out. Her service had been out for a few days previous to this, but they did not count this because no one had called to complain. I still feel violated for hours of my time.",
"Comcast for some reason credited our account for 1704.00 for 3 months in which time I was receiving bills saying No Payment Due but they then reversed the credit and billed me for all 3 months at once. Not sure if this is legal but contacted Customer Service and he just kept saying, ""I have no idea what happened but your bill is correct now,"" so I contacted Corporate Office. They stated that someone would call me by the end of the day in which they didn't, so I called again today got a woman who said, ""Well your issue was resolved. The credit was an error so we have fixed your account and you now owe the three months you weren't billed for."" I asked her how their mess up was fair to us. She said, ""Well it's your bill and you owe it! It was a mistake and it has been dealt with. It was done in error. I don't know who did it and why but it's over.""They are without a doubt the worst Company to have to deal with!!! They should be investigated because they do things that are so illegal... i.e. calling and leaving lengthy messages regarding overdue bills stating how much is owed and what will happen if you don't pay the overdue amount, yet when I called to complain about that I was told that ""FINE we will put you on the do not call list and if your phone gets shut off don't blame us"" and then dial tone!!! RUDE and illegal leaving personal information on an answering machine when again I called Corporate they stated they don't go by Mass Laws... Really I guess they are special...",
"I have been a customer for nearly 2 years. This companyâ€™s ONLY time of good prices is for the initial time period of a contract. After that the shake down begins, but also the service is HORRENDOUS!!! Very intermittent, never at the level that you are promised, but they charge you for it and brag about themselves as if their ads matter more than what they deliver. They beat you into submission because the only alternative is to block out five plus hours of your day for an incompetent technician to show up and basically change NOTHING... I know that most of the people using Comcast have no other choice or they wouldn't be here using it. This is the way it is. Like mafia the companies each mark out their territories and do their shakedowns... This is the one thing you can rely on with their services. You will be shaken down... period.Their service sucks. It is advisable to be very creative in your search for services before getting involved with them. It will become a headache you wish to avoid in no time at all. Wait lines for complaints are so long. This way the majority of us hang up before they have to be accountable... and like I say their technicians haven't got a clue what they are doing so a visit to your house is just a reminder of who is in charge so long as you are getting service from them.There are no basic services that are affordable. All there are is supposedly discounted services for the first year, which are high even to begin with, and then they trump up to ridiculous levels as the contract runs out. If only what they promised was what you got, but it isn't and trying to explain that, or get credits for it, well you have to put up with more home visits from their incompetent techs before they even talk to you about it. Their business relies on your not having a backup plan or ability to switch out. Don't go with this company. Try some creative start up. They just want your money through whatever creative means they can get it. Their services suck and are nothing to rely on, and nothing like as advertised!!!",
After reading a few reviews I had to write my own because I have run into the same problem. I have had Comcast for 7 months now and all I wanted to do was a simple address change and before I began Comcast put a random number on my account without asking me for one and they said they tried to contact me multiple times. So after I put the request to change to address I received a call from a lady named Andrea from the activation team stating I have a past due account from 2012 where I had cable for barely 2 months and before I switch my account I have to pay for it. 2012 I have no recollection of this and let me remind you I had service for 7 months. Paid on time and everything and paid off a previously owed bill. Long story short this Andrea lady put a block on my apartment so my roommate cannot get cable either and Comcast is the only cable service that is available in my area. SMH. My thing is I didn't receive one letter nor is it on my credit report that I owe anything from 2012 to Comcast so I'll continue to use their internet and on demand service free of charge since they won't let me pay for service that I already had.,
"It doesn't matter how much we, the customer/consumer (this is the Consumer Affairs website) complains about the extremely bad and very expensive service that Comcast does not provide because Comcast and the government are in bed together. Therefore, nothing will happen because Comcast does not have to answer to anyone. I have, as many others so many problems with Comcast only to have them unresolved. The new Xfinity 1 is probably the worst experience with TV watching I have ever had. When I switched, I was forced to have their modem and router together and the damn thing keeps disconnecting my wireless printer. I'm thinking it is when they do their updates in the wee hours in the morning. That is a treat to have to reset the printer & the tv after a reset.The phone service is one step below two soup cans and a string. Voice mail that dumps week old messages, even deleted messages into your mailbox 7 days later. Supervisors give you their phone numbers so you can call them directly, what a joke. They don't answer and they definitely don't return the phone call. DVR doesn't record scheduled recording, either series or just one show but it records other shows. It's selective recording or the NSA getting into our DVR boxes and deciding what we can record and watch.",
My experience with Comcast has been so stressful that I can hardly sleep. For one my bill is 688 and 80% of that is overcharges! My privacy was violated as they let someone have access to my account with my permission and without my SS number. I have called numerous times to try and get answers to why this happened and spoke to numerous people. One lady laughed at me and was extremely rude. Another man told me the person who tried accessing my account gave them my SS number. Every time I call I get different answers or they have no clue what I'm talking about! This place needs to be shut down or have some sort of investigation. There hidden costs and add on every month. One time they came to my house and took our line off the phone pole to disconnect us for no reason! So we had no service for days and nothing was done about that either! This company makes me sick. There is also more I haven't added but don't have time to write a novel.,
"When there was an issue with speed (MBPS), Comcast reps told me to buy their router for 10$ a month. That didn't fix it and I lost the salvage value of my own high-quality router from Best Buy, and am now paying another 10$ a month in addition to those damages incurred to me (and others, so I hear) by Comcast. After this didn't fix the issue, they wouldn't provide recourse and then required that I upgrade for about another 40$ a month to get my service working. These are bait and switch sales practices and are easy regulations. The company can be doing this to many people from the sampling obtained so far, and they will be paying millions. Attorneys, take note. If you don't see this in the news quickly, you better gobble it up for your firms. We're in the process of filing promptly to incentive them to stop doing this to their clients, not to exclude antitrust problems.",
I haven't needed a lot of support. My most recent call was to confirm that I had the latest cable box. The person I spoke to was very pleasant and helpful. I have had very few outages and the system has always been restored in a reasonably quick manner. I am on the 2nd year of a new contract so I get a lot of channels for a reasonable price. When this year is up I will reduce my cable services to maintain a price close to my current price. No problems with reliability. There are services I currently have but I don't use like DVR and many channels I don't watch. If I was paying retail for these services my cable bill would be much higher.,
"I have called multiple times for various problems and it's like I never called before. They have no record of my complaint, only that I have called. I have been waiting two weeks for a downed cable in the middle of our road. The fire dept finally had to come and cut the cable for safety reasons. They seem clueless and could care less every time I have called with an issue. They are a ripoff and continues to try and find ways to pork the customer. Such as, raising internet prices for customers who watch Netflix more than cable. They're going to find a way to make more money any way they can. I have never experienced a worse cable company than Comcast. I've called multiple times for this recent downed wire and they tell me each time the customer service representatives didn't put any notes in the system. Are you kidding me??? They suck, and if I had another option for internet, local news, and sports, I would cancel Comcast in a heartbeat.",
"Tried to pay my bill on Saturday. Was not able to access account online. Got a message my email address wasn't connected to the account. So I called waiting over a hour to make payment. I gave up. Made payment through my bank online. Well they didn't get it fast enough, shut my cable off, charged me fees, and I called today 2-8. After 3 transfers and 45 min later I got my service back on. I was asked 3 times how I sent the money. They are a monopoly. I hate them and there is no other provider allowed in my area. It is so horrible the way they treat their customers.",
"I changed a cable box from one bedroom to another. I called customer service to help reprogram the box. Well what a SURPRISE, they couldn't do it over the phone because they were incompatible. They send a representative over and then charge me a 38$ for coming to program a box! No notice on any fees just a charge. I call customer service. The rep. tries to tell me they changed a wire! Well my ** that happened, no wires changed! The representative basically called me a LIAR when I asked to speak to her manager and flat out refused! There has gotta be something we can do! Any suggestions?",
"I just called to reduce my bill and now Comcast has already increased two ""fees"" on the bill. I got no warning of the increases, and no explanation as to why these increased. Also with the new ""plans"" they offer, you have to pay for premium channels even though they are old movies and they run over and over. I don't want these channels but to get HD service, I have to go with this package and pay a higher price. It isn't fair and they are taking advantage because there is no competition in the area. I wish there was some competition in my area and I would switch in a heartbeat. This is not an isolated complaint, I have had to subscribe as I have no other choice. The bill is a different amount every other month and it never decreases. I am not getting anything better as a result either. Customer service is a joke. They just read from a script.",
This was the second time I had to call as they don't change the programming like they say they are going to. I would not even have Comcast but the apartment complex I live in won't let us have DirecTV. 4 more months of living here till our lease is up. Then we will have DirecTV again. Comcast sucks.,
"We were forced to use Comcast as the apartment building we are in uses those services exclusively. The DVR works 30% of the time, often not recording TV shows we have it set to record and not displaying any on demand shows. This is the biggest waste of money and we will NEVER use this company again.",
"I have never seen such a horrible service like Xfinity. Wish we have TWC or Verizon in my place. I am sharing some of my experiences below: Last week by mistake I clicked the upgrade modem link. I already have a docsis 3.0 modem, so I called the customer support and asked them to cancel the order. They said they took care of it. After 5 days I got the equipment from Comcast. Now I called them and after 30 minutes service desk told me to return it asap. Now I need to find a center and return it. For last few days, I am seeing tv service has been added to my account. I called customer care and told them I don't need TV service, cancel it. They said TV service not added to my account and no clue why it got added to my account. She said my plan is unchanged but I am not sure if Comcast will charge anything extra. After interacting to Xfinity customer care, it seems some time they are not aware of the things or mislead you.",
"Off to Target to buy a router/modem for my â€ªXFINITYâ€¬ service. Just in case anyone else was a gullible as I have been I want to let you know. When I signed up for XFINITY I asked if I could buy my own modem rather than ""rent"" theirs. I was told by their representative no I could not. That only theirs would work, no other kind was compatible. I am not the most techno knowledgeable person out there so I believed him. I have bought and paid for that damn thing multiple times over the years and I am pissed. When a friend was telling me about how they got a new modem at Target I was baffled. ""You can do that?"" So I am going to go get one, bring it home and make sure I can make it work. And then I am off to Comcast Cable to give them their damn modem and a piece of my mind (a small one, I don't have much to spare right now.) I feel bad for whoever gets me. I know it's not their personal fault but unfortunately they are going to have to hear about it. What a dirt bag lying piece of ** I dealt with. No idea who it was, I bet they don't work there anymore. So if you were lied to too, get your own modem, save money and tell them what they can do with it. Have a nice day.",
"Comcast raises prices throughout your 2 year contract. Each month my bill has been more than the previous bill. It went from 198.00 to 295.00. When I called Comcast customer service to find out what was going on, she stated that all the promotion deals are rolling off due to it coming to a end of my contract. If this was a 2 year contract why are all the promotions rolling off monthly before the 2 years expired. Then she tells me my next month bill will be much more than 295.00. I will be canceling and finding a new provider. This company has been a headache for me for years. Really Bad Company.",
"On August 11th I was watching a show on demand. All of a sudden my tv froze and my phones and Internet stop working also. I called Comcast and got disconnected 3 times. Was bounced around to multiple people and had to repeat myself over and over again, never mind the wait time. Finally someone fixed my phones and Internet. To this day August 14, my cable on my main TV and demand doesn't work. I'm a court officer in a busy busy court, Comcast stated that they would call my cell phone when they were going to be at my house on 8/14/15, surprise they never did.I asked my chief if I could leave because they were supposed to call between 1-4. I got home at 1:30 and received a message on my HOME PHONE that they was here and no one was home and that I would have to reschedule. So I left my job early, having to use my time and I haven't had cable or demand since 8-11. But my bill is paid every month. I think this company is the most unprofessional incompetent company I have ever dealt with. I plan on reporting them to the better business and telling anyone and everyone not to ever get Comcast. You would think that they would want to be proud of their company and do whatever it takes to help these customers. Not them. They are shameful.",
"Called Comcast to set a payment arrangements for a old account. The first gentleman I spoke with (wish I could remember his name) was a delightful, very sweet, helpful. Had patience pulled up my old account and transferred me to the collection department where I would be assisted further. After being on hold for 35 mins!!! The employee ""Phill **"" in collections was very loud, rude, didn't help me at all!!! He asked for a account number which I do not have, and considering another employee was able to locate a old account with no issue! Why can't he??? I asked to speak with a supervisor... He said they were all busy. I implied I would wait for one to be available (I work in a call center, a superior should be available at all times). He insisted that they were helping with calls due to the high call volume... which is ridiculous to me. Comcast you should get more employees if you have to take your superiors away from their job to help with another job!!! The agent ""Phill **"" was not customer services... He did not go out of his way to help me!!!! He was not polite nor sound friendly nor like he was smiling through the phone. He had a very angry tone and was very short. He is not what I want to speak to when I call a company - your employees represent you!!!Customer satisfaction is always a number one goal!!! Your call center employees are your direct contact to your customers!!! If a employee can not deal with stress, ongoing pressure, high call volume and can't assist a customer engaged and be personal make sure their experience with you was the best you could possible be, then fire them!!! I want someone that can help me after sitting on hold for 35 mins, not a employee that won't go above and beyond to assist me with my problem!!! You're called customer service representative for a reason - you represent Comcast. Comcast do a better job with the employees you hired. Horrible business. Also make sure you guys do coaching with your employees!!! Listen to the call with them. Help them fix errors or mistakes so they can become better!!!",
"Absolute worst customer service I have ever had. They transfer you to three separate people with thick accents and terrible reception who need you to tell them the information over and over again until they go, ""Oh, it looks like it's expired/not available/out of service."" SWITCH to another to provider and break up their monopoly. Please.",
I went to Comcast office and I ask if I can pay my final bill but the guy told me that he was going to mail it to me to my new address. I received a bill for $345.00 and I paid that bill because I thought it was my final bill and all of a sudden I found another final bill for 97.36 within two weeks of paying. I called customer service and talked to a guy name Net and explained to him about my reason for calling that I received a letter from credit bureau about the $97.36 and he hanged up on me. I was really surprise and mad that I never even received notice from them that I owe them money. I always pay my bill on time and I don't believe that it was necessary for them to take it that far for only $97.36. BE AWARE OF COMCAST BECAUSE WHAT THEY TELL IS NOT WHAT THEY DO. Make sure to record them when you have them on the phone. ,
"I have had problems with Comcast forever. Speaking with representative is useless and getting things resolved is frustrating. Recent conversation dealt with moving out-of-state, no service provided but yet charging term fee! Avoid!!",
I think Comcast are con artist and there should be an investigation because they tell you one price and make it easy till you get the high bill. Also they charge a month advance. Then if you move they charge 2 month in advanced. I think they are gold diggers.,
I have been in queue for online chat with a customer service rep for 40+ minutes. I've been 1 in queue for 20 minutes. I chose online chat because I didn't want to get stuck on hold for an hour on the phone. I have one simple question--where is my self-service box that was scheduled to arrive 3 days ago? I can't get internet access without it.,
I find it amazing that Comcast can run a commercial about customer service. Their customer service is the poorest that I dealt with in my life. When I asked to go to corporate level I'm told I can mail them a letter. Unbelievable. If you have any choice definitely don't pick Comcast.,
"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO COMCAST. Due to the virtual monopoly that Comcast holds over the Greater Boston area I had no choice but to use this company. They are HORRIBLE! I just finished my 5th, that's right, 5th call with Comcast this month to dispute my bill. Originally, I called because a bundle deal I had apparently expired, even though when I initially signed up for the bundle I was told there would be no expiration on the rates. I called and explained the situation and was told that there had been a mistake and rates had gone up. I was then forced into signing up for a bundle again (or so I thought) because I was told that it was the cheapest rate. Since that first call three weeks ago, my bill has risen by almost 40$. Each time I call, I then go look at my account and Comcast has added more fees on instead of reducing them as I was guaranteed they would. I have basic cable and high-speed internet and my current bill is MORE than what I used to pay with full cable and Internet!!! I called again today and was told that the bundle I was offered was non-existent! Apparently there was a technical error on their computer system yet I am being held responsible for this bill. Comcast never bothered to notify me this deal was unobtainable nor did they offer any insight into how to rectify the problem. All I was told, by a senior supervisor, was that I had to pay the bill and it would be rectified next month. I told the supervisor I was moving out of the state and would be canceling Comcast this month so there would be no future bills. Supervisor essentially told me ""tough luck"" and then became defensive when I said I felt manipulated by this company. I told the supervisor that I wanted to cancel everything right then and there, but apparently that's too much for Comcast to handle. Agents can't rectify cancellation issues and I was told I have to call another division, no contact information, no helpful tips, nothing. This is the WORST company I have ever dealt with and their service is something comparable to toxic sewage. In fact, I am going to make it my personal mission to help everyone I know and encounter to also become disillusioned with this horrendous business model. I will be sure to post reviews of this nature on every site that I can and I will never, ever use this company again. I would rather be mauled by a pack of wolves than give Comcast my business and you should be aware that if you use this company you will be ROBBED!!! If there was a choice more emphatic than angry, like ""volcanic eruption of rage"" I would have chosen that. Angry is the biggest understatement of the century. Get it together Comcast. Oh wait you can't, because your very foundations are the definition of vile and evil.",
"My business relationship with Comcast began June of 2014. I had recently moved into a rooming house with multiple cable hookups and wanted to get internet access. Since they are the only provider in the area I called their ""customer service"" number. I was told that I could easily go to the local office to pick up a self install kit to get up and running. So off I drove to the address they provided and upon entering discovered that I was given the address of their local marketing office! No worries, they gave me the correct address and I proceeded down the road to pick up my easy self install kit. Got to the office-great service, got home, and hooked up my computer to the cable in my room. My computer was online, but my neighboring roommate lost his cable service. Apparently the line that was installed in my room was actually his, so called ""customer service"" and set up an appt to have a tech to install (costing me more $$$). Success! Internet was installed and all was well... but in March 2015 received a call from a Comcast telemarketer offering me cable tv service added to my internet for only 5.00 more a month! Good deal so I said why not, she proceeded to send me an easy self install kit. Upon receipt, realized that with the way my cable was set up I could not self install. Did not want to pay for another tech to come out, so within 3 days took a trip to my local Comcast office and was assured that I would not be charged for the cable TV and my acct would return to the previous billing. Surprise! First week of April received a bill from Comcast. For the months prior to the telemarketing offer I was paying about $52.00 for internet service (overpriced in my opinion, but my only option). The bill was for $105.00!!! Called the customer service # and spoke to a nice guy who said he could credit me $10.00 for the cable tv self install kit, but I would have to talk to a representative in special relations to resolve the rest. He did agree that I should not be charged double for the same service. After being on hold for several minutes special relations rep told me that although I was offered a 30 day money back guarantee by the telemarketer, and I did cancel the cable TV service within 3 days, the offer I signed up for 9 months previous did not exist anymore! After going around in circles with her for several minutes she said she could sign me up for an ""economy"" internet plan for the same price I was paying previously (approx $52.00 with rented modem). She recommended that I pay my bill $95.00 (after the generous $10.00 credit!) and all would be resolved in my next billing period. So I checked out my acct online last week, and guess what??? I am still signed up for a cable TV and internet bundle for $105.00 month!!! I cannot deal with the telephone customer service"" people anymore, so will return to my local Comcast office to cancel everything asap. People should not be treated this way!!!",
"I am so frustrated. It's been over a week and I am still not fully connected. Here are my string of complaints: The sales representative only gave me 2 options to get my cable equipment, either spend $10 to receive it by mail or $80 to have a technician to install it. She did NOT mention that I could simply pick it up and get my cable hooked up right away. Oh, but of course, when I mentioned if I could get it faster, she said I could pay more for shipping to receive it the next day.The box came 5 days later with a set top box and two other smaller cable boxes (far too many). NOWHERE was the internet modem, which was most important part and the whole reason I'm stuck with Comcast in the first place (Sadly, Comcast monopolizes my area). I thought I had everything needed at first (the instruction manual is terrible), so I called to get the set top box activated. After a half hour of struggling with the sales representative, she told me that I needed to call the billing department to receive my services.Next day called customer service, surprise surprise, I didn't need to call the billing department. I also figured out through my own research that I needed that internet modem. Picked up the internet modem at the local Comcast store. Had to call 2 sales representatives to finally get it working. Then I find out that I need a splitter in order to use the same cable outlet for both internet and TV.Go to the local Comcast store AGAIN to pick up the splitter. Returned the extra little cable box I was sent (What a waste of packaging when I could've had that internet modem instead). Everything is hooked up and I call to set up the cable. Robot sends me to a sales representative and guess what? THE SET TOP BOX DOESN'T WORK. Looks like yet another trip to the Comcast store. I mean really, is it so hard to pack up the right things and make sure everything works? I want my $10 spent for shipping, this is ridiculous. I would never recommend Comcast to anyone EVER.",
"When I walked into the local Comcast store to pick up a new cable box, the young woman at the desk noticed that I had been billed for a piece of equipment that I never requested, had, or used. She said that I had been billed for this ""adapter"" or something like that, since 2009 and should be reimbursed (or credited) by Comcast. (She was lovely.)Fast forward about a year, I returned to Comcast to see about what had been done about the overcharging and it appears nothing had been done. I was assured that it would be fixed and was given a ticket number. Bear in mind that I have automatic deductions (from my bank account) for my monthly bill, and Comcast has not sent either paper or electronic bills in years.As per my request, I received an electronic bill the other day. They only credited me for the last six months of overbilling. I called and was told that the two agents that I had spoken with in person were wrong about my reimbursement - that Comcast has a strict policy that they will only, in essence, fix any of their mistakes from the last six months. I explained that I had spoken with someone a year ago and nothing was done. I also explained that I had no knowledge of being overcharged since they never sent me a bill.I'm basically an easy-going person, but when something this egregious happens to me, and most probably is also happening to others, I became, well, apparently 1 Star indicates ""angry"" so I'll leave it at that. I'm waiting for a supervisor to call me back (I'm not holding my breath) but the amount of time I've already spent trying to remedy THEIR mistake is ridiculous. How can they operate a business where they recognize their mistake and yet only agree to repay a small portion of a sum that they realize was erroneously deducted from my bank account?",
"A few days ago, I spoke to a salesperson to get service. I agreed to pay $109 without phone service, and that was the deal I made with them, plus $12 extra in order for me to get 105 Mbps of internet speed. I was also charged for three boxes. When the technician showed up and set up my service in my home, I got 12 Mbps instead of 105 Mbps. When I asked him why this had happened, he said that I should call the company so they could send me a technician from a different department to get a booster so I could get the internet speed I originally paid for. One of the customer service representatives told me to go to Best Buy and purchase the booster since the company didn't have them anymore. Another representative told me that my area does not have 105 Mbps. Now I am getting confused because the salesperson told me that I could get 105 Mbps, and the website also says I can get 105 Mbps. But now, the customer service representative is telling me that I cannot reach 105 Mbps, so now I'm confused. I'm urging every Comcast customer to check their internet speed, and see if it's what they're paying for. Comcast lies about what they promise to provide, and overcharges!",
"Is there ** minus stars??? I asked for a lower package, by taking off TV services, and to reduce the speed of the internet. What I found is that I am paying more (for the most expensive package of TV + phone services and internet!!! ) WT**!!! But I am only getting a slower speed service!! Those customer services/so called technicians gotta get it together! If you don't want to work, then don't! There is a reason why you are answering phone calls, first of all. It shouldn't be such a hard job, suck it up! Don't take your own problems on customers!",
"I contacted Comcast to set up cable and internet at our new apartment. I spoke with a representative and agreed to a deal where we would get cable, internet, and a DVR for around 100/month. Pretty good. A technician came 4 days later and hooked everything up. The internet worked fine but the cable box was buggy. The next day, I unplugged it and rebooted it which worked for a day and then nothing. On the next evening, I called back and after about 30 min on the phone, the rep said that a technician needed to come and fix it. This was on a Friday and a tech wasn't available until Monday. Monday: tech comes and says a cable was loose and that the box should be fine (I was suspicious, but I let it go). The box was fine... for an hour. When I got home from work, the box is completely frozen and won't change channels or anything. Also, that Monday, I received a bill for $260! I call Comcast, and tech support tries to tell me that I'm using the remote incorrectly. I'm not, I know how to work the remote, I promise you. So needless to say, I'm getting upset. So I tell them that I no longer want their cable service and just want the internet that was advertised at $40/month. They tell me that offer is available to new customers only, and since I am an existing customer, I would have to pay $80/month for the service. Seriously!? That was it, I cancel everything. Unfortunately, there are no real alternatives in my area. Comcast needs more competition. They have so much control that they can easily get away with hidden charges and fees and extremely poor customer service because only they can provide broadband service to a public increasingly reliant on such a service. It's time that we demand an alternative to this corrupted company.",
"Comcast must be the most incompetent company I've ever dealt with!!! I never write these types of reviews, but I already wasted so much time with Comcast, that I may just as well waste more to let others know to stay away from them if they don't want to be frustrated by their incompetency and lack of customer service. I had their cable/internet service at the previous address and moved. They scheduled a technician to hook up service. I had to stay home from work. He came but told me he was the wrong guy, because the house needed a rewire, but he'd put in a ticket. Nobody contacted me, so I called customer service a few days later. They said a technician is already scheduled for tomorrow. So I stayed home from work again. The technician came and, incredibly, told me the same thing: that he's the wrong guy and that Comcast needs to send somebody from another department to do a ""rewire."" He said he'd put in a ticket and to call the next day to confirm.I called the next day, but they couldn't find anything. I spent about 3 hours on the phone trying to reach the right group to schedule a rewire and get free backup wifi service from them in the meantime. They said I'd have to call another department to get the backup wifi service. So I did; only to have that other department tell me that I can't get free wifi service because I don't have Comcast service. I tried to explain that I didn't have Comcast service because they sent the wrong technician TWICE. They said I had to talk to another department and connected me. After being on hold for 30 minutes, the person from the other department told me I would have to call the wifi department. I told them that's who I talked to earlier. So they told me they couldn't do anything, but recommended to call a different department the next day to schedule the rewire job.I called that other department the next day and, after 30 minutes on the phone, found somebody who seem to know what's going on. They said they'll schedule the rewire technician to come by in a week. That's today. So I just received a call from Comcast early, saying the technician will be coming 1.5 hours late (after the 2-hour window they gave me). Out of caution, I asked them if the technician is coming to do the rewire job. They then told me NO! Their group doesn't do any rewire jobs and that needed to be done by the rewire group at Comcast. I just about lost it!!! The service person said they'll call the Comcast rewire group, put me on hold for 15 minutes, and said somebody from over there would call me right away to schedule a rewire appointment. That was an hour ago.CAN ANYBODY BELIEVE THAT??? I'VE NEVER DEALT WITH A COMPANY WHO SHOWED THAT LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE, DYSFUNCTIONALITY, AND TOTAL DISRESPECT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS' TIME!!!!",
"I had been a customer of Comcast for 8 years and until we moved we had not experienced much in the way problems with internet and On Demand. When we moved into our new house we started getting intermittent internet connections. We also started having problems with On Demand access. Every time we had a problem Comcast said they couldn't duplicate it and there was nothing wrong with the service.What finally made me decide to move to another service was that I decided to pay my bill early. It showed as an option on the website even though I was enrolled in Auto Pay. Well a few days later they deducted the payment again from my checking account. When I called they said that I would have had to cancel my enrollment in Auto Pay before paying early. It said nothing about that on the website. It took them 3 weeks to process the refund to my account.I cancelled my service on January 29th. On February 9 they deducted another month's payment from my account. Then they sent me a bill with a credit on it for a partial month rather than just deducting what I really owed them for for the February 9th bill. When I called to see when I was going to get my money back, I was told that it takes 4-5 weeks. That's ridiculous that they will have had my money for a total of 2 months. I would look at other providers first before doing anything with Comcast.",
"Why does it take five appointments and a dozen calls to get service? I have had comcast for many years but they contract with untrustworthy technicians. On this day I have been waiting and given a third time for which I can expect the tech to come to my home. I haven't even taken into consideration all the snow we had had in Boston but everywhere I look I see XFINITY trucks but they will not come to my house. I had one lie and said he came but nobody answered the door. Fresh snow had been falling all morning and there were no tracks indicating that someone had been to the house but this is acceptable!So far to date I have been given $120 in credits for NO SHOW TECHS! Today as I sit here waiting since 7:30 am for my scheduled appointment slot of 8 - 10, 11 - 12 and this last time 1 - 1:30 the rep guaranteed me I would get installation today! I have spent countless hour waiting on tech to install my cable, phone and Internet. If there were a better cable supplier I would go with them but I heard horror stories about Directv, RCN and Verizon.",
"Snowstorm - tree came down, took out all wires. NSTAR was there in under 24 hours, climbed the pole and power back on. After 4 no-show appointments from Comcast we finally were told our appointment had been cancelled. No call, no nothing, they said our driveway was not plowed well enough, so they just canceled our 4th appointment. The driveway HAD BEEN completely plowed and we have been driving in and out all day. Our 5th appoint, which Comcast tagged an emergency by the Comcast help desk is, again, a no-show. We are losing money everyday as one of our family members is an independent contractor who is dependent on our internet service. Why can this monopoly of a service on Cape Cod be allowed to continue to abuse and lie to customers. Can nothing be done about this? I am begging you to look into this matter. How can a company hold their customer hostage like this???",
"So I am now on the third day waiting for them to actually come to my house to install equipment. I laugh at their commercial that says 2-3 hour window appointments, HA! Yea, sure! This is by far the worst service in all aspects whether it be customer service or in home installation--they stink! In Quincy MA Comcast is a monopoly. There is no other service available for internet and tv. And they know this, I believe that's why they're such jerks. Calling them is incredibly frustrating. I now have to take off another day for the fourth time so I can sit around for an appointment they probably won't make either. Their service stinks, it's way too expensive. Also I tried to go online and order the DVR and have it mailed to me--never came. This is also the second time doing that so figured I'd try inhome appointment... again even more pointless.",
"Comcast is asking customers to sign up for a two year commitment for their best promotion, but they are unwilling to provide even marginally good customer service. After watching my bills climb to $186/month, I requested a disconnect and paid what I was told would be my last payment of $186 last night. I woke up this morning to find that the payment went through to my credit card along with another unauthorized payment of $209. I spent the day trying to get through to the billing department who told me that they would have to send ""a ticket"" to the finance department to have the unauthorized payment reviewed. When I asked to how long it would take to be reimbursed, they said they didn't know. When I asked to speak to someone in the finance department, they said that they couldn't connect me through. I've learned that if you ask too many questions, they just hang up the phone. After four phone disconnects in two weeks, I realized that must be how they are instructed to resolve a conversation. Comcast spends high marketing dollars on free visa gift cards if you refer a friend. Are you kidding me??? If I did that, I wouldn't have any friends.",
"Really Comcast? It's not enough that I pay $200+ per month for your services, but you want to charge me an additional $1.99 per episode to watch ""The Shield!"" A series that was free to watch when it came out on FX! I've heard you do this also with other episodes of old shows that were free to watch when they originally came out! I consider this gouging your customers! :(",
"We only have Comcast bundling out here in Western Mass. You can not even get a bundle thru AT&T and DirecTV. So they jumped my bill up 17.00 this month, stating they had to so Comcast would not lose channels and we have to pay for a service that is awful. I constantly lose internet service. We need help here in Western Mass. This is awful, we can get treated like this!",
"From the first day it was a headache. The technician came out to install and as soon as he started it was already not what I wanted. He added an extra box, apparently an extra outlet and the channels that I wanted were not included with the original price. Then he continuously ignored me asking him to stop the installation process. I decided to call Comcast so they could at least cancel on their end which even though they agreed to, they never actually did. After the installation was complete the technician refused to uninstall saying that it would take a lot of work and he had other jobs to get to. After enough arguing he agreed to come back when done with the other clients which he never did. I was definitely shocked when my first bill was over $300. When I refused to pay it the service was suspended and I was told that to fix any charges I needed to restore it first. There would be a reconnect fee as well as another $200 added on because it would start a new billing cycle. I figured that it would be fixed anyway so it would be ok. However at some point between my dozens of calls I found out that I was in a contract so not only could I not adjust anything I also could not cancel because of early termination fees. Again I refused to pay and was told that a supervisor would contact me to fix this and waited for a call which never came. The account was again put into suspension and is now disconnected with the added cancellation fees totaling $784 for the last 3 months. To top it off I'm once again waiting on a supervisor to return my calls and I am dropping off the equipment to avoid an additional $470. What a nightmare!!",
"In Massachusetts, in bill dated November 27th, Comcast gave notice of price increase effective December 11, 2014. That is very short notice of time. Comcast refuses to reply to me as to why the short time. I am interested in finding out if this is Comcast's policy in the other states. So I am asking people to respond by identifying their state and advising the date of the most recent price increase notice they have received from Comcast and the date of that price increase takes effect in their billing process. In short: date you received notice + date your bank or credit card was debited for the increase. So that this site is not filled with numerous duplicate responses from the same state, please check the answers to see if someone in your state has already responded before you answer.",
"Ongoing problems over one year. They have replaced every item in my house and out to the pole, more than once. Management support, corporate involvement. It doesn't work. Intermittent repetitive issues. Every time, you start from square one. FRUSTRATION. There should come a time when Comcast states... WE CAN'T FIX IT. Time to move on. Has anyone else had a similar experience with the X1 Platform?",
"I was going to pay my past due bill of 258.00 so that I can get services reconnected, but a Comcast employee told me I also must pay a past due bill of a relative. I asked them why when it's not under my name, they went on to tell me, well since that person is related to me I also must pay that past due bill in order to get service under my name. I ask how is it possible to be billed for another person's past due bill, they said it's a policy of theirs that a relative must be charged with an unpaid bill. So in other words I have to be another's past due bill account even though it's clearly not under my name or social security number. I really don't know how that's possible.",
"Comcast, you are robbing customers that made you to stay in business. Most horrified customer service experience. I hope you burn in Hell! It's shame shame shame. I am switching to RCN.",
"I pay for ""Blast"" Internet service with speeds advertised as up to 105Mbps. Not only have I not come close to this speed (the Xfinity service technician ran the Xfinity Speed Test and I was at 13 Mbps), but for the past several weeks and currently, my internet speed is running at a blistering 0.21 Mbps. I called in to ask for a credit to my account for internet speed which is less than their basic internet package speed. I was told that as long as I get any internet service at all, I am not entitled to a credit. That is completely ridiculous as I am paying for speed that I rarely get.",
"I used to pay my Comcast bill automatically every month with a credit card. Then my credit card got hacked, and Comcast's attempt to bill it failed. The bank got me a new credit card with a new account number, which I gave to Comcast. But the Comcast billing system seemed to have blacklisted me for the hacked credit card. From then on, whenever my bill was due, it refused to bill my new credit card--without notifying me. As a result, I would be watching TV and suddenly my service would go out.I would call Comcast's service representative and be told that my service was canceled due to nonpayment. This happened twice. Each time, I would give Comcast my new credit card number.  Each time, they assured me it would work. And each time, it failed silently and Comcast just cut off my TV service for alleged nonpayment. I told them that if it happened again, I was canceling my service. It did happen, and without further ado, I switched to DirecTV.",
"I contacted Comcast, reluctantly, after hearing of so many fraudulent practices, but they are the only gig in town. I called to order internet and cable service. I was told that I would get internet service and a basic cable service with 25 channels for only 39.99 and was also told that I couldn't get internet service only (I don't watch TV). I set up an installation date, rearranged my schedule to meet their needs and never received a confirmation letter. In the meantime, I needed internet service so I went to their website which states that you can receive free wi-fi through many different hotspots. They did provide me with a free hour of service. When the service expired, I went back to looking for the free ""hotspots"" and connected to a secure free x-finity network. However, to get service, I had to pay 19.99, nothing FREE about that, which would take me up to the day they were coming. I called them on that day to confirm and they said that my installation date was a week from that date. I explained that I had been told that day and they apologized. I then asked for a credit for the 19.99, as a courtesy, plus the 19.99 I would be charged for the extra week, plus the 19.99 for the other computer in the house (the 19.99 connection can only be accessed through one device).The customer service rep. put me on hold and came back and said that my bill would reflect a credit from the 70.00 monthly fee that I would be paying. I asked for the original price quoted, plus email confirmation of the installation date, plus credit for having to pay a weekly fee on each computer. I was told I would receive those emails in 5 minutes or so. I received no notification. How did I resolve it? I chose VERIZON instead. I can't get cable TV through them, only satellite, but I wasn't lied to and am not having money extorted from me. Why Comcast is allowed to continue to function under their current fraudulent business practices is beyond me.",
"We have been a Comcast customer for over 15 years at home and have other accounts too. I tried to change our services online as we hardly ever watch TV. Currently, we are paying close to $300 per month for TV, internet and cable. I tried to get $99 per month triple play and it would not let me. I signed as a new customer and got a call in less than a minute, but found out I have to call a different number. When I call the customer service, I was on hold and listening to advertisement for about 15 minutes and then they told me I have to call back on a week day. I ended up cancelling my service and sign up for a new service the next day. That saved me about $3000 per year. Anyone who feels they can charge existing clients about 300% of new customer price, needs to reconsider their business strategy!",
"I wanted to change the number of channels I receive which one would think would be easy to do.... alas over 90 min later with a rep on the line I am still being ""put on hold"". He keeps telling me things that are useless to me like ""Comcast does have packages that start under $100 for new customers"".... Well as a 10+ year Comcast customer, apparently those packages are not available to me, so why tease me! Just give me a fair price for a package that I can use!",
"Comcast has a terrible customer service. My wife was on phone with at least four different reps., asked for mgr and while talking was disconnected. Called back and asked for same mgr and the rep said they will call back, but never did. TERRIBLE SERVICE. I work for a utility co. myself and if we EVER TREATED OUR CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS we would be out of a job. COMCAST SMARTEN UP, will probably look for NEW INTERNET co.",
"The set top box had a defective HDMI port. I took it to the service center - a half hour drive, because they have closed the service center in my town. I was the 8th person in line, with only one person working at the desk. After half an hour, I finally got a new box. I drove home another half hour. The new set top box was defective. After waiting on the phone 20 minutes, and minimal troubleshooting, they set up an appointment to send a technician. They made the appointment for a place I own that is 3 hours away. When I called, they told me the earliest appointment they had was a week and a half away! After complaining, they moved the appointment up by 3 days. The most they could credit my account for all of this outage and failure was $20.00. What horrible service!",
"I had Comcast come out to my house to install a NEW connection. I needed a NEW connection because I had Dish for TV and they already were using the outlet in the room. And I was getting Comcast for Internet/ TV. The guy comes to the house to install the service. Mind you I was not home. Another adult in the house was. The guy then disconnects the coaxial going from the tv to the wall. He then connects the ide the TV was in to the modem and connects Comcast to the wall outlet.I get home and decide to check out my services. I then realize what he did. Now I was being charged for a service that not only didn't happen. But also this guy now messed up my Dish network. I call Comcast and explain to them what happened and that I need them to send someone back out to rectify the situation. The first lady puts me on hold. Somehow she must have pressed a wrong button or something. But I end up back on the phone directory menu. I then get the next lady and explain to her the situation and that they need to reschedule. Well it seems like everything is ok and they sending someone out, right? Wrong. I get a call back from them and their North East division stating the tech cant do what I have just requested. I argue with the lady a bit. Because by now I am just livid. I mean how dare you go to someones house mess up their services. And then wash your hands of the whole situation. Well after arguing with her I hang up. Then I get a strange feeling they canceled my appointment. So I call back the main phone number for them. I then get a guy, I will call him white noise because talking with him most the time there was just white noise. Until I decided to stoke the conversation. Stating I needed a tech sent out and the situation. He then after 20 mins states he will have the tech department call me to see if things are resolved the next day. I state ""What? You aren't gonna send someone out. You gonna just have them call?"" He says yes. I then just hang up the phone. Obviously they either are real dense or they just don't know real CS. So I then call Dish, they have a tech coming out today to fix Comcast's mistakes and put in a new line. At least they know CS. When I get home tonight, I will be calling Comcast billing. Not only should I not have to pay for incorrectly done work, which mind you messed up my other services. But I should also be reimbursed for the money I have to pay to have Dish come out.",
"The services from Comcast are overall pretty good. I get high speed internet, cable tv, and phone from them. The bad thing about Comcast is the inconsistency with their knowledge of their own products and the handling of any issues that might arise. I am above average when it comes to electronics and connecting things. If someone is totally ignorant as to what is needed for optimal performance, then Comcast could be a horror show. Sometimes an operator or a technician who comes to the house are very good at what they do, and at other times you can get stuck with a complete moron. My personal experience was fortunate because most of the people I dealt with were knowledgeable. I know there are many negative reviews but I think there is a problem with every provider from across the country no matter what the brand.",
"Order the new $99 month Comcast Xfinity plan. Receive my boxes on Friday it's now Monday still have no service. The customer service department is horrible. I called twice on Friday to set up my service nothing, I called five times on Saturday and a customer service representative hung up the phone on me. I also called about three or four times on Sunday. A Comcast technician came to my house on Saturday and could not fix the problem. I was guaranteed a technician to stop by today... never showed up! I rather pay $300 to $400 a month for service than to deal with the ** that Comcast has to offer. Comcast does not care about their customers nor do they care about anything else except for making money. I've had Chromecast for four days and I'm done with them. I'm canceling their horrible! I am a barber, I work at a barbershop with five other barbers, 350 clients. Every single person told me that Comcast is the worst.",
"Unfortunately I have been waiting since December to resolve a damage complaint and have made multiple calls to try to resolve the issue. Ticket ** (Comcast has extensive notes in their record). Additionally, I have been assured several times that my expedited ticket would be addressed immediately. I'm still waiting and getting more angry each time I have to call back.Long story short - I bought a new home, and on the day I moved in (Nov. 30) a Comcast installer came to hook up the cable. The installer drilled holes into my wall to the outside presumably to connect to the box. At that point he pushed a wall shingle off of the exterior and broke it, leaving a hole to the exterior that is not protected from the elements (not good in a New England winter). The installer then ran the cable out the wall and stapled it down the exterior wall breaking additional shingles, not saying anything to us about the damage and left. We had cable for about 45 minutes before it went out? We had to have another installer come the next week to get everything working. It was an absolutely unprofessional experience all around.To add insult the installer told us the jack that in the other room was working fine, it was not. We have now been charged because a service worker has come back to reconnect it? Needless to say this situation has been frustrating and has still yet to be resolved. I have been extremely patient with no result and am still in the same place months later and have upset my homeowner's association by having a hole in our wall. One last thing. The Comcast website is very frustrating, maybe its by design. I can't get logged on no matter what I try to do? Does Comcast care at all about their customers... you decide?",
"Comcast and the other companies like it have a monopoly in the areas they work in. I don't see how this is right/legal. I canceled my service with Comcast and had an $80 credit on my account, even though I only paid $60 a month for my services! I now have to wait 30 days for them to process my credit and send me a check. So they make us over pay for a service and when we cancel, they make us wait 30 days to issue us a credit. Great policy for Comcast. Bad Customer service and policy for the people they are gouging.",
"This was sent to Comcast this morning. I have never been as frustrated as I am with Comcast. I will be leaving Comcast----I would rather have an ugly dish hanging off of my deck--which I despise than continue being ROBBED by Comcast. I am a longtime customer. Between May and June of this year I paid $700.00. I just paid 400 dollars in the last week and they say I still owe 300. I pay every single month. I never skip a payment. Two months ago I spoke to a customer service rep and he admitted he didn't see some of my payments online, which truly concerns me---since money is coming out of my account. I spoke to someone on Thursday and his attitude was disgusting; when I told him I paid 700 dollars his attitude and quirkiness in his voice was yeah right...prove it to me and when I came home my service was shut off. AGAIN I PAY every single Month and I am OFFENDED that my bill is sooooo high each month when it is suppose 179.00 and I pay over that amount each month. The fact that they charge 179.00 is unbelievable and unrealistic. I could understand if I am not paying; however I pay every single month.",
"My ex and I contacted Comcast customer support in January to transfer the account out of my name and into his, since he had an apartment lined up and I didn't. The CSR we spoke with assured us this could be done over the phone. Two months later I got a past due call from them saying my account was being suspended for nonpayment. I told them the account wasn't in my name anymore and to contact my ex. A month later it happened again. I asked why they were still calling me, and was told there was no record of any transfer, and they would have to mail me paperwork to fill out and mail back. I cancelled the account at that time and called my ex, who called Comcast, and the CSR he spoke with told him we'd both have to show up in person at a customer center to submit the paperwork... which is what we did. The person we spoke with at the customer center when we appeared assured us the transfer could be completed this way, so we submitted the paperwork.A month later it happened again, only this time they were looking for their equipment. I told them we submitted the transfer paperwork, and was informed that our request was ""declined"" because I didn't follow the instructions properly. I asked how that was possible, since I was following the instructions they gave me, and they told me they had a right to decline the request if they saw fit. I told the CSR to mail the paperwork to my parents' address and I would fill it out and send it back. That request was never honored.  I started receiving text messages and phone calls multiple times a day from Comcast demanding the return of their equipment. I kept trying to explain that I didn't have it and they needed to contact my ex, but every single CSR that contacted me informed me I was still responsible for the account and therefore responsible for returning the equipment. I called my ex and he swore he would return the equipment. I received a phone call from a collection agency, explaining that Comcast had sent my account to collection because the equipment was never returned - I didn't even know that was possible. I explained the whole horror show to the collection agent and gave them my ex's contact information and asked them to call him. At that time I filed a complaint against Comcast with the Better Business Bureau. Less than two weeks later I got a phone call from a Comcast Executive person who tried to tell me the original request for the transfer wasn't done because my ex had a prior account with Comcast that was never satisfied, so he wasn't eligible for an account. I asked her why in all this time not one person ever mentioned that before, and in fact why I had been given a number of other reasons for the request not being honored, and she told me - in all honesty - ""Our employees cannot be expected to have that kind of information"". When I asked her how I was supposed to know such a thing, if no one ever bothered to mention it in all this time, her response was that my ex should have been honest with me and told me, himself. Then I asked why I was still being held responsible for the account. She informed me that I was responsible because I was the one that was ""with him"" at the time. I'm not paraphrasing. This is exactly what she said to me. At that point, I completely lost it and started yelling and swearing at her. I dared her to sue me. I was beyond out of my mind with anger and frustration, and I absolutely could not believe a service professional was saying these things to me.As a side note: my ex has not been contacted even once by anyone at Comcast to discuss the reasons for the request being ""declined"" or to inquire about another account that wasn't satisfied. As far as he is aware, any prior account he had with them was paid in full. I have never in my life been so disgusted with a service provider. Not once has a single employee of Comcast been honest with me, been willing to work with me to resolve the issue, been willing to accept responsibility for the issue, or anything. Since this whole mess got started, every employee of Comcast I've spoken with has put the blame and responsibility on me alone. I kept asking what more they wanted me to do, and not one of them ever answered me, so I still haven't been given a clear way to resolve the problem. It's as if the company does not want the issue resolved at all, which I cannot understand. What do they possibly have to gain by preventing me from concluding my business with them???",

Changing channels using the ""RNG150N"" box takes 3-5 seconds, resulting in a series of black screens and sometimes a grey screen. The ""RNG150"" box has no problem changing channels. I have swapped the boxes between the two TVs and the result using the ""RNG150N"" box is the delay in channel change. I have complained to Comcast for almost a year now, requesting that they replace the ""RNG150N"" box with a ""RNG150"". They claim they can't because they don't know if they have one in the service center or with a tech.",
"Came off seasonal disconnect on May 1. I visited the house on June 8 and found all COMCAST service dead as a door nail. Comcast box in basement had no lights. I arranged for tech to come out on June 13. Tech spent 2.5 hrs and fixed everything including a new interface box in the basement. I contacted customer service on June 17. They told me because of seasonal disconnect, they would give me a credit of $256. Asked if I should pay the current bill, they said, ""Wait till you get the credit."" NO credit on the bill. I called and they said, ""There is no indication from the last rep that you would be getting a $256 credit."" I spoke to a supervisor and all he could belch up was scripted garbage. He did not even know what CRM was!! He did not even know the rep who authorized the $256!! I asked for his supervisor to call me back... ""They're all at a meeting. I will send them an email,"" he said. More garbage... what do you believe no one will call me back!!!",
"Let me start off by stating I cannot wait until the day comes that Comcast goes the way of AOL. Since my very first apartment, I've had non-stop issues with Comcast's slimy fees and money-squeezing tactics. On my first bill at my new apartment, I paid the amount due in full via bank transfer, filling out my account number, routing number, etc. on their website. Mind you, this is how I pay for every other service I have (cell phone, utilities, credit card bill, etc.) and somehow Comcast is the only one that manages to screw it up.So after I made my payment online, I got a confirmation screen showing my balance was paid. When I logged back online several times after, it continued to show $0.00 due. About a month later, Comcast mailed me a letter saying my service would be shut off for non-payment, and that I have to contact their CS to resolve this. I did so, and the Comcast automaton, who clearly worked from a script, kept telling me I owe $200 something for non-payment. I explained to him multiple times that I was logged onto my account right now while talking to him on the phone and was looking at a screen that said I paid the bill in full. The automaton told me he didn't know what I was talking about and basically I had to make a payment right then and there to reactivate my service. After doing so, as expected, my next bill had a list of fees totaling about $50 (return payment fee - $20, reactivation fee $5 each for phone, internet, and cable, late fee - $6, payment over the phone fee $6).I still don't know what happened to the phantom payment I made, but basically Comcast's opinion is that my payment didn't go through even though their own account online said it did, and I'm 100% liable for all their fees. They refuse to refund anything or even accept responsibility for their website's error which said the payment went through. This is absolutely incredible. The only thing I can think of is maybe I entered a number wrong, which in that case it should have declined the payment. Instead, Comcast charges you $20. Could you imagine if you were charged a $20 fee for every payment you made online that didn't go through? I can't believe Comcast is still in business. I can understand why they are trying to re-brand themselves as Xfinity. Given the decades of horrible service, Comcast has a stigma of service somewhere on the same level as USPS, and quite deservedly so.",
"I am disputing an install fee that Comcast has unlawfully charged me. I signed up with Comcast on 6-8-12. I was sent a self-install kit to install it myself. After trying repeatedly, I was unable to get the cable or internet to work. I spoke to Comcast and they sent out a technician the next day. When I had met with the technician, he determined that the apartment I was living in did not have the cable from the telephone pole to the house that was needed to have Comcast service. He assured me this was not my fault, that they should have never sent me the self-install kit to begin with. I spoke with Comcast a few days later and they agreed to credit my account the cost of the installation. The next bill I received did not have the credit and now Comcast is saying I will have to pay the install bill. I am disputing this charge. Please assist.",
"I called to set up a payment arrangement on 6/18/2012. The payment was to be withdrawn from my checking account on 6/22/2012. The payment was withdrawn immediately. I called Comcast and spoke to several people in multiple departments, including a supervisor. I informed the supervisor that the early withdrawal would cause other outstanding checks to bounce, causing me embarrassment and many dollars in fees. They informed me that there was no record on the computer of my intent to pay on the 22nd. So, I said, that doesn't change the error. They refused to reverse the payment. I told them I would be taking any overage fees from my next Comcast bill and was told they would disconnect my service. She said they have no policy of accepting payments made in the future. Not my issue if the representative is not trained properly, she accepted the date of payment. When I asked to speak to someone else, she chuckled and said she'd look for someone. Then I was disconnected.",
"I'm outraged at the cost of basic cable (10 channels) and internet - $60/month. I purchased a bundled service with Comcast last year. I was told I didn't have a contract, yet this year the fees increased by 33%, and they can't even tell me how long this next step in the pricing is good for. When I asked what options I have, the answer is, you can pay more and get less service (i.e significantly slower internet). Obviously, I'm only a basic user and there are no competitors in my area. I'm stuck.I want a business model where I have a monopoly and can raise prices 33% per year and call what I deliver a promotion. Do they really think they are giving us a deal? Does it really cost $60 per month for internet service and 10 (what should be ""free"") channels? Someone needs to oversee these people and force them to provide their service at a reasonable price, especially if there are no competitors. Ridiculous!",
"On April 21 and April 22, 2012, I attempted to pay an outstanding balance with Comcast online. I am a paperless customer. I completed the procedure twice and got a ""try again later"" message both times. On April 22, I tried to contact Comcast, but their online ""help"" is useless and I couldn't find a telephone number on the webpage where I could call. So I sent an email outlining my problem - difficulty paying online, paperless-billing customer, would my account be double-debited for the $425.57 payment, would my service be disconnected? A return email directed me to a Comcast online ""analyst"" who said I couldn't be helped because I didn't have my Comcast billing number (remember, I'm paperless) and I wouldn't give the last four digits of my SSN number. Both my husband and I have been victims of identify theft. I don't give out my SSN to anyone, but my physician and my bank. So I'm stuck. Either I've paid my bill or it haven't. Either my account will be double-debited for the same amount or it won't. This is not customer service. This is customer abuse. It is very difficult to get a problem addressed by Comcast. If I had an alternative, like switching to another cable provider, I'd do it in a heartbeat. But I'm self-employed and need the internet to work, as does my husband. Hope you can help by collecting dissatisfied customer data.",
I discovered that SoapNet is out of line up. I want it back!,
"I called to cancel Showtime from my cable bill. My name is Maureen **. My husband Harry died in 2008. His name is on the account. Since his death, I have added internet service and premium station. In order for me to cancel Showtime, they want a death certificate. I have written every check since the 70's when we signed up for cable. I spend one and a half hours trying to get a supervisor, email address or even who to write. No one has called me back and I am totally frustrated. ",
"I had Comcast installed on October 14, 2011. I was told that if I kept my account in good standing, I would receive a $100 gift card within 6-8 weeks after my first 90 days. On March 5, 2011, I called to see when my gift card should be arriving. I spoke with the customer rep and she told me that it is in the mail and I should receive it by the end of the week. If not, call them back on the 12th. So I called back on the 12th and spoke to another rep who said it was in my records that I called but no info about my card. I was then sent to the rebate department. I was told there that Comcast never sent over the information and no card was even in the process of being sent. I had to call back and asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told it would take another 6-8 weeks for my card and she was not sure why I was told it was in the mail. I asked what they are going to do about this. She told me that she would send a note to the supervisor of the rep who told me it was in the mail and I would get a call back today 3-12-12. Well, thereâ€™s no call back. I told the supervisor that I was not the type of person to write things down. I would never have gotten my gift card and Comcast would not have mailed it out to me and I would be out the $100. Can you imagine all the people out there that have forgotten about this gift card? I am more angry that I was lied to and no one even cared enough to call me back and try to explain what happened. My contract ends on October 14, 2013 and I will not renew my contract with Comcast. I want and need answers to what happened. I pay over $150 a month to this company and they could care less about there customers. Itâ€™s not a very good way to get new or keep old customers. Thank you.",
"I was charged for a tech to come out and fix my cable due to defective equipment. Unbelievable! Iâ€™m on hold for 30 minutes just to speak with a manager and thereâ€™s no help. Theyâ€™re saying too bad, not their fault. Not only that, they blew my TV one year earlier for not grounding the wires in the basement when they first installed cable at my house.",
"I am 67. In all my years. I have never, ever dealt with a worse company in terms of product. Your support people are lovely and they trying to be helpful. But let me tell you what we have suffered with Comcast cable TV and Comcast Tivo: Awful, awful service. We have been able to use our TV about 2 months out of the last 12. We have had your service people here at least 15 times in the last year or so. We simply never can watch TV. Our service is always not working. I asked for a supervisor to call me back. None did. If I say that I will take your follow-up survey, the phone rings but there is no one there. I feel as if I am in the third world of a third world country. You truly can't represent yourselves as a service. You are a disgrace. We are switching service: Our computer, our TV, our phone and will never, ever use a Comcast service again. Further, I will be contacting our reps in congress to point out that you do not merit your licensing.",
"I reduced my Comcast cable service from Digital Starter to Digital Economy to save $40 per month as I was not using the extra services and channels.The channels clearly listed in the Price adjustment information sent out in December 2011 effective 1/22/2012. Problem is the second and third TV using the small converter box now only get half of the channels advertised in the listing. There is no mention of this in the footnotes of the terms of service. I think Comcast should have to live up to what is advertised and allow these channels to be viewed on the second and third TVs, not only one TV.",
"A dispute regarding an upgrade order and 'installation charge' resulted in a phone call to their customer service center. They charged me installation fees though the order clear said they were waived. After being told that I would have to send a signed copy of the order to them for proof (it was their order! They got three copies and I got one when it was penned!), I asked to speak to a supervisor. I got a friendly, ""Sure, please hold..."" After 10 minutes, they simply hung up on me. When I called back, I was told that my previous call (10 minutes before hand) had been successfully closed with the issue being ""resolved to customers satisfaction."" Based on both of these experiences, I concluded that Comcast hires liars and cheats. I sent in copies of the paper work.",
"I was lied to, straight out. They quoted me a specific price for a package and specific stations on phone for more than 1 hour discussing monthly fee. On the same evening, the home channels discussed and ordered were not activated. The bill was approximately $20.00 more than quoted. Our conversation was recorded. How can I expose this? Some one help. I'm locked into 1 year contract at price much higher than agreed upon.",
"I have been trying to get my guide fixed but Comcast can't even get my address right. Their customer guarantee is a joke. They are rude, keep you on hold forever when you call. Comcast needs to be investigated.",
"We have been without cable since Oct. 29th when we had a bad storm.  We have made repeated calls and waited many times for over 1/2 hour to speak to someone.  At first, they would tell us that someone would call us back the next day and no one did.  So, we would make several calls back.  This has been going on for over a week.  We are told every day that we are on the schedule for the next day and voila, they never showed up.  This is the worst customer service that we have ever experienced.  Itâ€™s been 15 days with no service.  All our neighbors are up and running and our cable is still on the ground.  When we get a chance to switch to another company, we will do it in a heartbeat.  This is ridiculous.",
"I have had multiple home visits from them to replace nonworking DVR boxes.  But after eight months, I am still having problems.",
"Plain and simple--Comcast is awful.  Upon moving to a new apartment, we contacted our cable and Internet provider at the time (Verizon) to have our service hooked up at the new address.  Unfortunately, the move took place during the strike and we were told that they would not be able to hook up our service until the strike was over.  We went without cable and Internet for three weeks and finally decided to go with the only other option we had left (besides satellite TV), Comcast.  We reluctantly went forward with the decision since Verizon has Comcast beat by a mile from prices, packages, and quality.Comcast has an angle for everything and charges tons of extra money for things that Verizon automatically includes in their service.  We have had Comcast for less than a month.  While the Internet connection is fair, the cable quality is downright awful.  The channels continuously go blank or ""scrambled"" for several minutes at a time and the Channel Guide seems to reset and has ""To Be Announced"" in place of program titles.  Needless to say, after less than a month of service with Comcast, we are switching back to Verizon now that the strike is over.",
"I have had to replace my cable box three times in the last three months.  This was due to service interruptions or certain aspects of my cable package not functioning properly.  A technician came out to my apartment and replaced my current box (500 gb of DVR storage) with a refurbished model (100 gb).  According to the company, consumers across the board are paying the same price for different amounts of memory service.  Within 4 days, the refurbished cable box had stopped working.  I was told I would be charged for another service call, and that I had to go to a service station to replace the cable box myself.",
"I've been without cable since Sunday, 8/28/11 and today is Wednesday, 8/31/11. I'm very upset about this - no cable, no phone, and no internet. I've been a Comcast customer for years and this is very bad. I know about the storm but four days is too much. I hope when I get home tonight it will be on. ",
"Late last summer my 46 inch TV stopped wprking. I called Comcast as I wanted to see if it was my TV or the cable box. The repairman came out just use some electrical testing equipment and said the box was good, but the TV was no good. I asked him if he could hook up another box to my set and be sure. He said he didn't have room in his truck for another box. (These are quite small). I told him I had another box on a TV upstairs, could he use that one. He said I don't have time, it's your set! That day I bought a new 47 inch LG set from Best Buy. It was delivered 3 weeks later as in Massacusetts they had a sales tax weekend and it created quite a backlog of orders.It was the box all along. I called Comcast and they sent another man along who brought in a new box, which did work, but for their cheaper program. I told him I wanted the one I was supposed to get and he told me they were all out, but he knew where he could get one in a few days. Later that day I called Comcast and they did have the correct boxes in stock and a new one was installed.I called Comcast about the initial repair persons error, but was told I should have gotten a second opinion.",
"They 'upgraded' the guide 7/11/11 and without notification or price change eliminated: timers; ability to save dvr shows onto vhs tape (a huge thing!); can't view 5 programs on guide, 1 line hidden by new ad space which keeps bleeping in and out; no more audio/video settings to customize view; have to change view settings to one-view to read all guide info.

"I have ""basic cable."" I used to get the Red Sox baseball games and the local news on basic cable. Xfinity changed that so all I get with ""basic cable"" is a bunch of Spanish channels, two Boston channels and a bunch of PBS stations. I can no longer get Red Sox baseball or the New England Patriots football. Both of these sports programs are available off-the-air in the Boston area and according to my interpretation of the FCC rules, therefore are supposed to be duplicated on the cable.Therefore, Comcast violates FCC rules. Any attempt to fix this, either through the FCC or through Comcast fails. Comcast claims that any lawsuit will fail because their lawyers are paid for by their stockholders while my lawyers are paid out of my pocket so I should, ""see the consequences of any such action."" This was their response when I threatened to sue them.",
"I am a loyal Comcast customer abused by rude representative (operator BZB) while paying bill at Marshfield, MA office.On July 1, 2011, I had an upsetting experience here while paying my bill.  There was an error on my balance (recently downsized services and had credit, which wasn't reflected on balance due).  The male service representative (operator BZB) approached me at the counter.  Barely a moment after I inquired about the error, he rudely replied, ""I'm not going to spend an hour with you!"" He went on to say, ""last time I spent 55 minutes with you and later you complained about me.""I stood there stunned as he insulted me with a coworker and customers present.  Refusing me service, he made me get in the other representative's line.  Evidently, he held a grudge against me (the consumer) for wasting his time the prior month!  Yes, I spent time reviewing options, figuring out which services to change, etc. I turned in cable boxes for free adapters to save dollars.  Once home, the CC technical department couldn't activate them (operator BZB failed to enter needed codes), causing us a loss of cable for two days! Who should be mad over wasted time and mistreatment?",
"I cancelled my account in November. When bringing back my equipment, I was told I ordered a router in September and I need to return it. I stated I didn't order it nor received it. They said they have evidence that it was received by UPS (without a signature). They did say the router was never activated. Ironically, I purchased my own router after having issues a few months earlier and was never offered a free router. After speaking with Yolanda **, an account manager with Comcast, she said not to worry about it and asked for a receipt for the router I purchased and agreed to reimburse me $139 for the last month plus an extra $50 for the router and I should receive a check within 4-6 weeks.After waiting 7 without a check, I called and was told I need to file a claim with UPS for the lost router before they would send my check. No one at Comcast said I needed to do this but I called UPS on 12/27 and they told me it was Comcast's responsibility to contact UPS, not mine. I don't feel Comcast gets to keep my money for a router I never ordered and was going to be given to me at no cost. If I had their equipment, I would give it back. There is no evidence I signed for it nor activated it and I want my refund!",
"About three months ago, I called Comcast customer service to change my bundle package for one that I search on the internet which is for 12 months. Customer agent offered me a free promotion of three months of show time, Cinemax and sport package free and a Latino package free for six months. Today, I called Comcast customer agent to remove the first free promotion of showtime, Cinemax and sport package. The customer agent said to me that my package will expire by next month and that the price was going to be higher. I said to her how could that be if I just picked a new package the same day the free promotions were offered to me. I asked her that I wanted to speak with a supervisor and she denied it to me and also argued with me that the same thing she was telling me it was the same thing that the supervisor was going to tell me. I asked about three times that I wanted to speak with a supervisor or someone higher than her and she would not let me to speak to anybody else but her. It is ridiculous how these companies offer packages to the customers they don't place it in the system and then the customers end up paying more and trying to take advantage of customer to get more profit base on the economy at this time of life. ",
"My husband and I moved into our new (just built) house in February.  The first Monday after we moved in, we had a tech from Comcast come to set us up with cable, internet and phone.  We are on a main road but our section didn't have a lot of houses up, so Comcast didn't have any lines to tap into to hook us up. The technician couldn't tell us anything.  After calls to Comcast, we were told that this problem would be fixed between six and eight weeks!  ""But don't worry it never takes that long.""  We didn't have any of these services for almost four months.  My husband called every week and would always be transferred numerous times repeating the situation to either get no help, a ""we cannot disclose when the third-party will be there to set up lines, etc.""  He finally reached someone who seemed to know what she was talking about and asked if he could have her direct line and she said she didn't have one.  So continue with the hundreds of transfers, repeating the situation over and over again.  You would think that they would document things so this wouldn't happen.On Demand goes out on our TV every week, you call the number on the screen-always the same answer, you have to unplug your cable box, re-plug then wait a half hour. You would think it would be fixed so it didn't go out.  They gave us HBO for three months as a ""sorry"" but then automatically charged us for the premium channel once the three months were up, instead of notifying us. Last night, November 9th 2010, my husband went on the internet at 6 was fine.  I went on at 8:30 and our internet and phone service wasn't working.  It said that we had a strong connection but no access was available.  My husband called Comcast and talked to some kid from Novia Scotia who had no idea what was going on.  He asked how the two services were lost but not cable and the response was, ""well, I think the phone and internet is connected somehow.""  I hate Comcast and laugh at their customer service commercials but it is the only option we had in our area! ",
"I should have sensed trouble in the fact that the installing technician was in such a hurry to get the job done that he could hardly give me the time to explain what he had done. Since that day, I have had trouble with my internet. Access has been barred to many sites and a Comcast message comes up ""Oops! Activation incomplete.""I have called three times. Nothing compared to some of your contributors and the last call to a ""supervisor"" (I wonder) I was assured that the problem would be fixed within 48 hours at the most and probably less. Well, no surprise, four days later nothing has been ""fixed."" My frustration is only beginning, I guess, but one does wonder about the financial impact on the company to have to keep coming back for ""fixes"" instead of getting the job done right to begin with. I would think it would be more cost efficient to do quality work in the first place, even if it cost a bit more to hire better qualified technicians than to string the work out over several weeks, months, years? I'm sure the costs incurred is being passed on to the customer(s) so maybe they do it on purpose. Is this fraudulent?",
"I moved from my former address to my current address in July. When I received my bills I paid them. I realized that the Comcast bills were not just being forwarded to the new address they were actually for the old address too. I called today to ask that my $333.59 be returned to me. They wanted to keep it and credit toward my new address. They then said that I would receive a phone call in 3-4 days from someone to discuss it.I said none of this is acceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. After being on hold for close to 9 minutes, Akidra transferred me to Ebony. Ebony had no authority to make any changes. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she said there were none. This is the last straw for Comcast for me. They sent technicians to my house that were subcontractors that barely spoke English. He tried to charge me extra for phone jacks, made the cable too short so I am unable move the box, left dirty foot prints all over the house, left the covers half screwed on wall, and left hand prints on my silk chairs. I am switching back to Verizon.",
"During the last storm both TVs started to switch off while the cable box remained on. I live in a condo bldg. None of my neighbors had a problem; no other piece of equipment in my home had a problem I did not even have to reset a clock, everything bigger than a clock is on a surge protector. We called Comcast and they suggested unplugging the cable from the signal source and power, wait, re hook and then they sent a refresh signal. This worked for 1 TV but not the other; we retried this several times, no luck. I brought the cable box down to their office and exchanged it, no luck, they sent several techs out. Everyone wanted to blame lightning or my TV but I do not believe my TV could break the one in the other room and wouldn't lightning have some other effect?No one had an answer for this. Finally after many calls I got a supervisor who agreed the right thing was to file a damage claim and promised it would be settled soon, per protocol she had to send the tech supervisor ok. He called after the 72 hour window I was given and after I called around looking for him. By now a couple of weeks have passed. He promised to be at my home by 11am and after I called around again he came a bit before 1pm. He to tried to blame other things but could not explain what was mentioned above, agreed to process the claim and told me to expect a check 24 hours after the claim was filed. Too bad he told the claims lady it was my fault and he did not know why I was calling the insurance co to settle.Then the icing on the cake I am reviewing my bill and originally I had a bundle that included 1 DVR and I paid for a second. When I turned in the faulty box that fried my TV I downgraded and so now I am charged for the 1 DVR. When I called the woman on the phone said I will call you back. Geez-louise I bet they can't face me.They should feel bad. Fios is not available in my area and the know it. All those automated call backs to see if I am happy because customer service is important? Do I laugh, cry? Move into a cave. I even offered the tech sup to take the broken TV to examine it but they did not want to.",
They have a lousy service and the clicker doesnâ€™t work right. They told me the program wasnâ€™t right for me and they are the ones who programmed the clicker. It is a big headache! I am dropping Comcast. End of the story.,
"The service technician cut multiple building cables, removed a 4 to 5 ft piece of each cable during installation of service in a neighbor's unit. It disrupted service to 2 of 3 units in a 4-unit townhouse building. Another technician repaired two of three cables but refused to replace the third. I want the cable repaired. It's part of the building wiring. I am a long time customer who they do not seem to care about. I've got nothing but the run-around from Comcast support people. I waited all day for the technician since half of the work had to be performed in my unit. And then he refused to repair the cable to my unit. Without satisfactory resolution to this problem, I will initiate a police report against Comcast for willful destruction of property. I will call the States Attorney office after speaking to my lawyer. I will call the BBB and the local radio and newspaper offices and raise the level of attention concerning field techniciansâ€™ behavior and lack of customer service/satisfaction. The service technician seem to be putting customers in the middle of their ****  contest with Verizon. It does not appear to me to be a very smart thing to do. Facility wiring was destroyed. It was done in such a way that it is difficult to repair without access to multiple units.",
"This is a copy of the email I sent to Comcast - using their email form.""Upon agreement between myself and the customer representative that there was something wrong with the recording/playback part of the, We set up an appointment for today (Wed - 21 July) to replace the cable box. The tech brought a cable box that was rather beat up and an older model than the one I already have and he suggested I would be better off going to the walk-in station in North Scituate and getting one myself. He didn't offer to come back tomorrow with at least a matching cable box or better than the one being replaced.When I called Comcast after the tech left to explain that I was not satisfied with the way this was being handled, I was told that my service call had been listed as 'Canceled. ' I then asked if I could at least call the walk-in facility in North Scituate to be sure they had a unit available, she said that she couldn't give out that number (and that even she couldn't call this Comcast facility - it was against the rules).Is this the kind of treatment a customer should expect for the $150+ I pay every month for the three services I subscribe to from Comcast.?

"I decided to reduce my TV service to basic cable. Iâ€™m being charged $150.00 (plus the bill), saying there was ""an agreement"" for another year. Thought I was safer than paying over $115.00 a month for internet and TV, until they told me it has to be paid within thirty days or both services will be shut off. I called the ""billing"" number and Iâ€™m being charged $4.00 to speak with a rep (added to the bill), and now I am being charged late fees (pro rated) plus the bill and the fee to reduce my services. Comcast is a nightmare for people who are on fixed income and trying to meet their other bills, like rent and utilities and food. And in this area, there is no one else to go to. Iâ€™m trying struggle on a fixed income to pay other monthly bills and still can't watch a decent program on TV. Complaining doesn't get you anywhere. I contacted the FCC and tried to find out who makes these fees, and why, and I was told itâ€™s company policy. No other utility company does it. Thanks for letting me vent.",
"I am writing to complain about a general problem. It is 7am and half the channels available to me are ""paid programming!"" I am paying a basic cable rate of 63 dollars for Comcast to make profits by removing real programming and put on shill advertising, much of which the producers of usually get convicted of fraud and larceny (See Kevin **). Why are they allowed to do this? They are charging us to selling us programming they are in return paid to air.There either has to be a reduction in rates equal to the amount they take in in paid programming or this programming must stop. In the worst economic crisis in the last 30 years, Comcast's profits were up nearly a billion dollars in late 2009. I do not begrudge a company making a profit but isn't this supposed to be similar to a public utility company. That's why we let them wire up the cities. The old Mayor of my hometown warned of this type of rampant abuse of the public trust, when cable first came to the City.",
"I have been harassed by Comcast and threatened to have my internet disconnected for supposedly too much internet usage.  They shot an obscene number of gigs which they are claiming my family uses more space that my hard-drive even contains.  I was told when I signed up for Comcast that there was no limit to downloading and just for the record, I do not download anything illegal.  If I download something it's because I payed for it or I download virus protections and software updates.  When I asked to have this sent in writing, they completely denied me.  They said that they don't send that stuff out!  If they are not sending their customers download limits, then how are we supposed to know?  They told me whether or not I pay for it, they don't allow it.  Isn't that a breach of contract under Comcast's fault? I use my computer for business purposes the majority of the time and I have a disabled child that is computer dependent because of severe handwritten skills; he needs the computer.  Comcast and their phone operators did not wish to comply with my requests at all.  What can I do and what are my rights?",
I ordered the Comcast triple play for $99 a month. I have had the service for 8 months for a total of $792. I have paid them a total of $1082 and still owe $584. That is more than double the advertised price of $99 a month. The service was shut off without cause.,
"For months, we were bombarded with TV ads and countdown clocks that said TV was going from analog to digital. If we had TVs that were cable-ready hooked up with a coax cable, we did not need to do anything. Everything was fine. I didn't need to do a thing. Now, I have received a letter from Comcast that I will need to get DTAs (digital transport adapters) for all my sets. I will get one digital cable box and two digital adapters free of charge, since I will need one additional adapter. It will be $1.99 per month. I must do this by April 13 or I will lose stations 24-69, since they are now going digital. What? I thought that is what already happened!On March 16, I picked up the required equipment. We hooked everything up and called for activation as required. Bam...I lost all HD channels. We called Comcast and were informed that we will need to get HD boxes. The first one is $7 per month, and each additional is $13.99 per month. I pay $68.48 per month for extended Basic cable. The additional cost would bring my monthly bill up to $117.45. How is this even legal?We were told by Comcast that we do not pay for the channels. We pay for the equipment. Really? If I don't rent their equipment, I will lose channels. Just seems like another cable ripoff to me. I buy HD TVs and cannot enjoy them, unless I pay Comcast for the privilege. What do you think, and can anything be done to stop this? When stations first went digital, the government gave out coupons to the people who could not afford new TVs to help defray costs. Now Comcast has found a way to undermine that. I am on a disability, awaiting a lung transplant. I certainly cannot afford my cable bill to almost double, just so I can actually enjoy the HD TVs I paid for. Something has to be done to stop this.

"I have been subjected to inconsistent billing and communication about my charges for the past six months. I have been forced to call into Comcast customer service multiple times to rectify the errors, which somehow appear again. Each time, I am promised a new package, and a worry-free future, but it only lasts a month until I see my next bill.Sample this: I have been put in four different packages upon recommendation of your customer service reps, each time I have not been told about terms of the contract or package exclusions. I was even awarded a $50 credit for miscommunication by one of your reps, which never showed up, and I find out it did not because I was not entitled to it.Is this how you treat your valuable customers? Five years and I am not counting anymore. I am switching out of a majority of your services because I have tried in good faith for the past six months to be a loyal customer. It doesn't work like that with Comcast. So here I am, I complain for one last time. I expect no response, but I do hope you fix the number of bundles and conditions you place on customers with unclear transition points between each and varying contractual obligations. It is a maze that nobody can possibly solve.Some of your reps are polite, but the last one I spoke to was rude, cocky and even careless about my account history. Adieu Comcast, mostly, because you still have a monopoly on TV in my area. ",
